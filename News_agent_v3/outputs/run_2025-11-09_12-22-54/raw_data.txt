Post Content:
Hello, I'd like to learn more on AI. I'm a math/CS undergraduate and would like to learn more about artificial intelligence. I have some coding knowledge in C and assembly but I don't think that's any useful in this field.  1. How to jailbreak a locally ran LLM?  2. Locally ran LLMs and what can I do with them (I already have LM Studio and qwen model)?  3. How can I make my own 'version' of a popular model and how can I customize it further?  Can you please answer the questions I have or at least point me towards helpful learning resources for topics I'm interested in?

I hope you are good at and enjoy the math, because your CS degree is absolutely failing you.

   4.1. (1 ⬆️) Well yes, it's like 70% math 30% cs

5. (1 ⬆️) Seeing as you have a math background, why not start with what these LLMs are? I've been into neural networks since forever, so to me the new part was the transformer block (though I still don't "get" how error backpropagation works over so many layers). There's a very good playlist on the topic by 3blue1brown.

Jailbreaking refers to crafting a prompt. Don't see how that would be different when running locally, nor why it's at all relevant to your purposes.

   5.1. (1 ⬆️) The problem is I don't see the connection with math. I have knowledge in real analysis, linear algebra and abstract algebra but I don't see 'the connection' to LLMs or machine learning in general because I just don't know anything about them.

6. (-2 ⬆️) That's a great goal, and it's normal to feel a little overwhelmed at first. The industry is vast. The key is to build a solid foundation first and then specialize.

Here's a path I would recommend based on your experience:

1. Learn the Fundamentals (Don't skip this step!): Your programming knowledge is a great start. Now, learn the basics. The best starting point for understanding the "why" behind the algorithms is still the Machine Learning specialization offered by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

Thermals are a major engineering challenge, the only way to get rid of heat in space is through black body radiation, there's no medium to transfer heat to. It's probably one of the, if not the biggest challenge in making this happen.

I've been using Sora for a bit but I'm finding it hard / too expensive so looking for alternatives that can give me more generations. The way I see it is we have 2 options, commit to a specific video generation platform (Sora, Veo, Kling, Seedance) or go to an aggregator that gives access to multiple.  My main question question is what are the main differences between specific model providers and these aggregators? I've been trying tools like SocialSight for AI video generation and the main thing with Sora is that there is no watermark. Also some of their models seem to have fewer restrictions like Seedance.  Not 100% sure what the best route is, but having multiple AI video generator models does seem more appealing.

1. (1 ⬆️) Wan. The amount of control is amazing, look at the pirate video someone made months ago 

2. (1 ⬆️) Sora is tough on generations. For e-commerce ads HypeCaster or Pictory are solid and aggregators like SocialSight offer broader access.

Not sure if it's just my feed, but I’ve been seeing a ton of posts about the [Orb](https://world.org/)/World ID on Reddit lately. Some people are saying it’s dystopian eye-scanning nonsense, others think it’s the future of proving you’re human online without giving up your identity.  I’ve read a few things and honestly I still don’t know what opinion to have. Like, it sounds useful with all the AI and bot spam out there, but also kinda weird???  Anyone used it or looked into the tech more deeply?

I have been doing some research and I found out that TPUs are much cheaper than GPUs and apparently they are made for machine learning tasks, so why are google and TPUs not having the same hype as GPUs and NVIDIA.

1. (382 ⬆️) Because most of them aren’t for sale.
   💬 Replies (1):
   1.1. (33 ⬆️) Exactly, but why?

2. (112 ⬆️) They are. Theres plenty of AI startups building on TPUs nowadays.

But:

\- (Even more) vendor lock in. You can at least get Nvidia GPUs from tons of cloud providers or use them on prem. TPUs are GCS only.

\- No local dev. CUDA works on any affordable gaming GPU

\- Less software support. If youre going all in on TPUs you basically have to use JAX. I think its an amazing framework, but it can be a bit daunting and almost everything new is implemented in torch and can just be used. PytorchXLA ex...
   💬 Replies (1):
   2.1. (4 ⬆️) I get that, but why are google not trying to compete with Nvidia GPUs, by making them available outside GCP, and creating more support?

3. (47 ⬆️) Google is the main source except their goal isn't to sell them to other users but rather to use them for their own stuff instead. If they ever had excess then maybe they could start doing so but it'll be a long time before this ever occurs. And even if that was the case, there isn't really a reason to do so. In a time where companies are vying for AI superiority, having exclusive access to better, more efficient hardware is one of the most important parts to achieve that.

4. (24 ⬆️) GPU is somewhat general purpose. Not as general as a CPU, but still.

A TPU is a dedicated circuit for matrix-matrix multiplication, which is computationally the most important operation in machine learning. By eliminating the generality of an instruction processing unit, a TPU can be faster & more energy-efficient than a GPU. But you can not run games on a TPU like you do on a GPU.

Of course current CPUs and GPUs are starting to include TPU-like circuitry for ML efficiency, so the boundaries a...

5. (8 ⬆️) Google doesn’t care about selling TPUs. Unlike AI they have the talent to both create foundational model and productise it too (no company on earth has one of the best hardware + one of the best research talent + one of the best engg talent)

6. (6 ⬆️) It's important to realize there are some key differences between a GPU and a TPU.

A GPU is a more general purpose device. For example if one has sparse matrices (comprised mostly of 0's, as in the mixture of experts models from DeepSeek and others), a GPU is flexible enough to support sparse operations efficiently, while current TPUs cannot.

From a buyer's perspective, new innovations like MOE and low precision math are still appearing regularly in ML, and the greater flexibility of GPUs (and ...
   💬 Replies (1):
   6.1. (2 ⬆️) TPU can absolutely support sparse workloads. It has a SparseCore

7. (3 ⬆️) Also, why AWS Trainium chips are almost unknown. They are widely available through AWS cloud and are cheaper than Nvidia nodes with the same performance.

8. (3 ⬆️) I mean, is an H200 really a GPU anymore… no one would use that for graphics .. So really its only called a GPU not a TPU because of its history

9. (2 ⬆️) TPUs being better for ML is a theory but in practice GPUs are much easier to use due to how mature the software stack is, and they are way easier to get even on GCP. TPUs are painful to use, at least if you’re outside of Google. GPUs are also more cost efficient, at least they were for our models (adtech) when we did an evaluation.

10. (2 ⬆️) TPUs are great at what they’re designed for: large-scale matrix ops and dense neural network inference, but they’re not as general-purpose as GPUs. NVIDIA’s ecosystem dominates because it’s mature, flexible, and developer-friendly: CUDA, cuDNN, PyTorch, and TensorFlow all have deep GPU support out of the box.

TPUs mostly live inside Google Cloud and are optimized for TensorFlow, which limits accessibility. You can’t just buy one off the shelf and plug it in. GPUs, on the other hand, run everyth...

Hey all,  Recently I made a post about Knowledge graph traversal: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/s/RAzcGCatN6  I got a ton of constructive criticism about the research and I thank everyone for the comments. The main thing I realized was that it’s not a knowledge graph (ontological facts) but just a cosine/semantic similarity graph (cosine similarities).  I have seen a lot of people in the sub here talk about fact/ontological knowledge graphs significantly more though. And I wanted to kind of spark a conversation about something.   I did most of my research into cosine similarity graphs, but I’m curious if it’s possible to do some kind of combination of cosine similarity AND fact/ontology. Or if there’s even necessarily a use case for something like that. Additionally, and this was the big thing I found interesting, was having an LLM traverse a similarity graph proved very very effective at recall.  I’m wondering if anyone has wanted to explore fact/ontological knowledge graph...

2. (3 ⬆️) So this has been a major problem for us as well, testing AI workflows, chatbots is very tricky at this stage, because you don't have fixed inputs and outputs.   
So what we have done, rather than testing, we are using LLM as judge for our complete trace and give it a score using LLM itself, and then use that data to understand where LLMs are lacking and hallucinating the most and as we collect more data we understand the issues better. We have created custom LLM as judge on langfuse for this.

Criteria: Accuracy (fact-check outputs), relevance (context match), safety (no leaks/toxicity).

Automate via LangChain evals or DeepEval in CI/CD, script test cases for prompts/responses.

Ragas is solid for RAG testing too.

LangChain starts earlier and has more industry/community adoption while CrewAI is relatively new. I really like to CrewAI concept where you build a team of agents more like what we have in real world. Any thoughts on the pros or cons of the two frameworks? Which one you do like the best? 

TOP 10 COMMENTS

1. (6 ⬆️) LangChain if you want **full control and customization**, CrewAI if you want **fast multi-agent teamwork** without the heavy setup. I’d say LangChain = power user, CrewAI = plug-and-play.
   💬 Replies (3):
   1.1. (2 ⬆️) make sense
   1.2. (2 ⬆️) Both are redundant
   1.3. (1 ⬆️) no, Langchain does not give you full control it is very opinionated

2. (6 ⬆️) I used both and honestly neither felt quite right for production work. LangChain has the ecosystem but gets messy fast when you're building something real. Too many ways to do the same thing, abstractions on abstractions, and god help you when you need to update dependencies.

CrewAI is cleaner conceptually but still felt a bit like it's solving for demos rather than production systems.

3. (3 ⬆️) CrewAI’s great for quick multi-agent protos, feels natural and fast to build with. LangChain’s more mature and scalable but heavier. I’d play with CrewAI first, then move to LangChain for production.

   💬 Replies (1):
   4.1. (1 ⬆️) Once Strands gets implemented in typescript I’m all aboard

5. (3 ⬆️) I would say start with something simple. I reviewed LangChain/LangGraph and although I like it it's too complicated to scale. LLamaIndex is also much easier to use. Consider whether you will need human-in-the-loop. LangGraph does it much better than LLamaIndex.

6. (2 ⬆️) I for the life of me cannot get crew AI to not save my traces to their stupid web app which is a non-starter for many enterprise applications. Also a huge red flag that none of their solutions I tried worked.

7. (2 ⬆️) They both suck. In fact, all current frameworks are simply trying to bolt LLMs on top of traditional software so make things very hard when it comes to building agents with any non-trivial agent behavior.

Here's how you "should" be able to write your agents -

So my question, who is the actual beneficiaries of AI hype except Infosys raking up thousands of crores.

1. (48 ⬆️) Good old Infosys. When is the world going to realise these consultancies are full of shit. 

I’m working with Accenture at the moment and they are a steaming pile of dogshit. Then the most basic of IT is rife with issues and errors.

2. (15 ⬆️) Infosys is the beneficiary 

As it was intended to be. 

They are deploying AI and simultaneously saying "it will probably destroy society", and they are still doing it. It obviously only benefits like 10 ultra rich people, they are doing everything to everyone as a fuck you. They and nobody cares about how much governments pay for it. It's a scam made to make them money.

Earlier, income tax return used to be processed within 2-4 weeks, AI powered ITR processing system wants to take 9 months.

How on earth has "AI" made life of income tax payers a hell in India?

Why couldn't you just name the company or at least write  "A dogshit IT consultancy firm ahs made life of income tax payers a hell in India"

Typical day in the work of these shitty Indian IT companies.

8. (4 ⬆️) I call bullshit on this post. I got personal and business income tax refunds in record time the last financial year. 

If there’s a delay it’s due to your shoddy income tax filing not AI or Infosys.

Google made its billions learning what people want on an individual basis. AI is now learning intimate details of billions of people's thoughts, feelings, desires, prejudices, mistakes, secrets, hates, loves, etc. A top level highly detailed query of user interactions could reveal an extremely detailed list of specific people with very specific characteristics and ideologies. This could be used for exploitation, political persecution, or worse (think Purge). Not today. But the trajectory of world politics is not exactly making this ability for the oligarch class look like a good thing at all. Plus, it feels like data centers are going to be as numerous as McDonalds soon (exaggeration for effect).

[https://openai.com/index/ai-progress-and-recommendations/](https://openai.com/index/ai-progress-and-recommendations/)  I find it quite intriguing that the Trump admin seems to be underwriting these folks.  There is a disconnect here somewhere.  Either a:  Trump wants the socioeconomic contract to change, or b: he doesn't and he thinks somehow he can get people to vote for a K shaped rich richer, poor poorer scenario.  (yes, or c, he's just clueless)  I wonder if the labs are forcing the GOP to go in on AI by scaring them about china when really it's about changing the .'socioeconomic contract'.  I guess china has found a way to export socialism.  Just export their OS models and force a change in the socioeconomic contract.

Our AI agents can read/write to prod databases, call external APIs, and access internal tools that even our senior engineers need approval for. Management says agents need broad access to be useful but this feels backwards from a security perspective.  Is this standard practice? How are other orgs handling agent permissions? Looking for examples of access control patterns that don't break agent functionality but also don't give bots the keys to everything.

1. (14 ⬆️) It's a red flag and should not be done. 

I am an expert in operational AI and an AI keynote speaker guiding businesses on doing these things safely. (https://trentgillespie.live)

This setup is backwards. You should never give agents broad access. Instead, give them task-level permissions only.

What that means:

Break workflows into individual, clearly defined tasks.

Each agent gets access just for that one task.

If you can, in enterprise systems, use short-lived credentials that expire once...

2. (8 ⬆️) Wow - sounds like a security disaster waiting to happen.

First, agents should follow principle of least privilege via granular IAM roles, so should be scoped for narrow, specific tasks - not broad, admin or super user permissions.

Second, we use a policy enforcement gateway so AI agents never directly interact with production systems. These gateways can rigidly enforce IAM policies, restrict operations, validate formats and calls, sanitize output to prevent exfiltration, and detailed logging.
