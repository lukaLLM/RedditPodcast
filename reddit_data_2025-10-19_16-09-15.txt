1. (54 ⬆️) I just scrubbed through the videos. It's not digging all the way down into the math, so you don't really need much linear algebra knowledge to understand it. Mostly talking about architecture stuff. 

It's a medium level overview of:

- tokenization
- self attention
- encoder-decoder transformer architecture
- RoPE
- layernorm
- decoder only transformer architecture
- MoE routing
- N+1 token prediction 
- ICL/CoT 
- KV Cache, GQA, paged attention, MLA (which only deepseek really does), spec deco...

   1.4. (8 ⬆️) Nah, I’m going to screenshot the Discord message (as a JPEG no less!) and post it to BlueSky. They need to hear about this.
   1.5. (4 ⬆️) I didnt see it early enough, I would have removed it. Now, I dont want to nix  the discussion.

2. (84 ⬆️) I think that we need an AI box with a weak mobile CPU and a couple of stacks of HBM memory, somewhere in the 128gb department + 32gb of usual ram. I don't know whether it's doable but that would have sold like hot donuts in 2500$ range.

So they can have the same kind of architecture and networking stack on their desk as in the cloud or datacenter.

Nvidia doesn't miss opportunities.  This is a fantastic opportunity to pawn off some the excess 5070 chip supply to a bunch of rubes.
   4.2. (3 ⬆️) I have good reasons to believe that Nvidia is testing the water for a full pc launch without cannibalising its GPU offerings. The investment in Intel just tells me so.

5. (20 ⬆️) The RTX Pro 6000 is multiple times the cost of a DGX Spark. Very few people are cross-shopping those, but quite a few people are cross-shopping “build an AI desktop for $3000” options, which includes a normal desktop with a high end gaming GPU, or Strix Halo, or a Spark, or a Mac Studio.

The point of the Spark is that it has a lot of memory. Compared to a gaming GPU with 32GB or less, the Spark will run circles around it for a very specific size of models that are too big to fit on the GPU, but...

Home LLM inference enjoyers can go for the Ryzen 395 and accept some rough edges with rocm and mediocre prefill for half the price.

The more adventurous DIY builders can go for a whole bunch of 3090s. 

Oilers can get the RTX 6000 or several 5090s.

Hey all, I've been building a website from a while ago in which we track the benchmark results from the official papers / model cards that the labs publish.   I thought it would be interesting to compile everything in one place to fill in the gaps on each model release.    All the data is open in Github and all scores have references to the original posts.  [https://llm-stats.com/benchmarks](https://llm-stats.com/benchmarks)  Feel free to provide candid feedback.     \---  \*\*We don't think this is the best approach yet\*\*. We're now building a way to replicate the results from the most interesting and useful benchmarks, but we understand that most of them haven't been created yet.  Current benchmarks are too simple and are not testing real capabilities. We're looking to build interesting, real world, independent benchmarks with held out data, but that can be easy to reproduce and extend.  Another thing we're currently doing is benchmarking across different inference providers to mon...

When comparing, it takes the scores if both models have been evaluated on it.

We’re working on independent evaluations, soon we’ll be able to show 20+ benchmarks per comparison across multiple domains.

3. (9 ⬆️) It’s like a metacritic score but for language models.

4. (7 ⬆️) On the home page, it seems to be sorting by GPQA alone and assigning "gold", "silver", "bronze" based on that which seems... really bad. It doesn't even make it clear that this is what's happening.

I also expected the benchmarks page to provide an overview of sorts, not require me to specifically select a benchmark to see anything.

According to  [https://opendata.blender.org/benchmarks](https://opendata.blender.org/benchmarks)   The Apple M5 10-core GPU already scores 1732 - outperforming the M1 Ultra with 64 GPU cores.   With simple math:   Apple M5 Max 40-core GPU will score 7000 - that is league of M3 Ultra   Apple M5 Ultra 80-core GPU will score 14000 on par with RTX 5090 and RTX Pro 6000!

1. (202 ⬆️) Bold to assume this scales linearly. Check M4 Pro with 16 vs 20 cores. The 20 core model does not seem to be 25% faster than the 16 core model. It's about 8% faster only.

Also, the blender score says nothing about prefill speed. Also, the batch performance of these nvidia cards you mention are still another question. It's absolutely unrealistic that this will be matched, and as far as I know currently there is no inference engine on mac that even supports batched calls.

   1.3. (8 ⬆️) > Check M4 Pro with 16 vs 20 cores

That's because both 16 and 20 cores have the same amount of RT cores, and Blender heavily relies on those to compute. Same goes for M4 Max 32 and 40 BTW.

Linearly wrt what? Memory bandwidth isn't even listed.

2. (187 ⬆️) Nvidia doesn’t have a monopoly on inference, and they never did. There was always AMD (which costs roughly the same but has inferior support in the ecosystem), Apple (which costs less but has *abysmal* support, and is useless for training), massive multi-channel DDR5 setups (which cost less but require some strange server board from China, plus Bios hacks), etc.

Apple prices its base models competitively, but any upgrades come at eye-bleeding costs. So you want to run LLMs on that shiny Macbook? You'll need to upgrade the RAM to run it and the SSD to store it. And only Apple charges €1000 per 64 GB of RAM upgrade and €1500 per 4...
   2.5. (8 ⬆️) I can only **very mildly** disagree with Apple having abysmal support, Qwen3-next and VL runs on MLX day 0. I haven't been following but I know that most users here are using llama.cpp which did not have support until recently or through some patches. So there is some mild support I suppose.

3. (44 ⬆️) Blender is a completely different workload. AFAIK it uses higher precision (probably int32/float32), and usually, especially compared to inference of LLMs, are not that memory bandwidth bound.

Assuming that the M5 variants are all going to have enough compute power to saturate the memory bandwidth, 800GB/s like in the M2 Ultra gives you at best 200 T/s on a 8B 4-bit Quantized model (no MoE), as it needs to read every weight for every token once.

Apple said it was faster when M4 was announced:

Seed OSS 36B might be interesting. I think it's one of the more unique dense models to come out in a while. I'm a little surprised that nobody's done a fine tune just to be the first with "Sneed 36B".

3. (12 ⬆️) I saw this coming a mile away, the endless storage was not sustainable, but it is indeed a huge problem, especially when quants for big models (50B - 100+B) can take x10 the space of the full precision weights.

The thought of having these limits alone is not very nice, what do we do? Only publish gguf? wait for one of the 2-3 major quanters to release a quant, and then delete our own quants?

4. (11 ⬆️) Delete older LLMs? Reduce the number of quants by checking which quants are the most downloaded. You make great finetunes but I can't imagine every one of them is worth keeping as you improve on them over time and better LLMs come out to finetune.

Post Content:
This went pretty under the radar, but a few days ago the 'Meta: Llama 3 70b' model went from 0.13c/M to 0.38c/M.  I noticed because I run one of the apps listed in the top 10 consumers of that model (the one with the weird penguin icon). I cannot find any evidence of this online, except my openrouter bill.  I ditched my local inference last month because the openrouter Llama price looked so good. But now I got rug pulled.  Did anybody else notice this? Or am I crazy and the prices never changed? It feels unusual for a provider to bump their API prices this much.

1. (43 ⬆️) A few weeks ago I napkin-mathed GPU rental and there was no way to beat the market price on openrouter with rental hardware \*at that time\*, and owning didn't look good for anything other than constant use. Looks like the market is correcting, and some players are abandoning the market altogether (e.g. https://lambda.ai/inference)

   💬 Replies (2):
   2.1. (36 ⬆️) Running on a 24gb GPU llama 3 70b gives around 20t/s. A 4090 costs min ~2000$. For that money, 0.38c/M gives you ~6B tokens. Which will take the local 4090 ~7 years of continuous running.

Price wise there is just no contest, even after increased prices.

I might run something smaller though.

I got a Llama 8b to a cost of ~5c/M if I use the GPU 24/7 (with monthly rental). I had to fine tune and quantize it even for that. I ran it with VLLM to increase throughput.

4. (9 ⬆️) Deepinfra announced this a few weeks ago, quite a significant increase.

5. (4 ⬆️) there was a discount period from a specific provider (Crusoe) who offered 70% off for a limited period of time, but $0.38 is roughly an average price for the model. I checked my openrouter history, since I call all types of models frequently (including the one you mentioned, which is Llama 3.3 70B btw, not just Llama 3).

here's also a tweet/screen: https://x.com/OpenRouterAI/status/1938735144824652005

It's hosted at a higher output price too.

7. (1 ⬆️) Sucks to have prices change for something you are using. Sounds like you either have to accept it or switch models. Gemini 2.0 flash , gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-oss-120b (reasoning) are models you might want to try if you want to switch. They are all incredibly cheap and on average better than llama-3-70b. 
   💬 Replies (1):
   7.1. (2 ⬆️) Also llama-3.3 70b , Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 are very cheap. Guessing people just migrating away from the older llama3 and inference providers want to hasten the move away from it by increasing prices 

8. (-1 ⬆️) Most of the reason these companies are still able to operate is because Intel won't sell the B60 to the public yet and AMD won't sell the RX 9700 Pro retail.

2. (10 ⬆️) Ollama use the quantized version, while the original/full models are usually in 16 or 32-bit.

And you're comparing 2 different quants, MXFP4 vs Q4_K_M, where not all part of the model converted to 4-bit, thus have different file size, since they're quantized in different ways.

Any larger version of GTP-OSS is pointless, including Q4KM.

so, here you go: this model is unusual in that part of the model comes quantized. there is not enough support built into various things for mxfp4 to work for every downstream task, so to perform operations on the model people completely unquantize it to bf16 so the tools work, then it gets requantized by ollama in a totally separa...

4. (-25 ⬆️) Abliterated has literally no refusal layers. That's what abliteration means. You are removing a huge chunk of the model itself, to remove its ability to disagree. 

You look through the model to find the layer that contains all the "Sorry, i can't do that", "No, this is incorrect", etc - and just yank it out, along with all the stuff that is on that layer.

That's why abliteration almost always so catastrophically affects model performance. It's not a fine-tune that skews the bias, it's literall...
   💬 Replies (2):
   4.1. (39 ⬆️) That's not true, there is no such thing as a refusal layer. When you hit a vector that indicates refusal, you calculate its negative and then add them. It's a Lora that charges the weights.
   4.2. (3 ⬆️) Got it. So, why does the ablated version take 23 GB more than the original one?

Another question: Is this the go-to path people are taking to "uncensor" models nowadays?

Sebastian Bubeck is the leading author of the 'Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence ' paper which made a lot of headlines but was subsequently ridiculed, for over interpreting the results of his internal testing or even that he misunderstood the mechanics of how LLMs work. He was also the lead on Microsoft's Phi series of small models which performed incredibly well on benchmarks but were in fact just overfit on testing and benchmark data. He's been a main voice within OAI for over hyping GPT-5. I'm not surprised that he finally got called out for misrepresenting AI capabilities. 

TOP 10 COMMENTS

1. (61 ⬆️) Bubeck’s follow up message reads like someone who is trying to cover their ass. His originally tweet clearly implies that, well, to quote him: “two researchers found the solutions to 10 Erdos problems over the weekend with the help of gpt-5”.
   💬 Replies (4):
   1.1. (17 ⬆️) Right. Sellke’s post was fine, but Bubeck at best represented it in a way that was easily misinterpretable. Obviously Bubeck agrees (after being called out) or he wouldn’t have deleted it.
   1.2. (12 ⬆️) He was technically correct. He "found" the solutions. Solutions from other people.


The slimiest form of correct.
   1.3. (12 ⬆️) Right but that’s what they did, found the solutions, just via literature search. It’s not clear from that tweet that’s what he means but if you follow his quoted tweet which then quotes his first tweet from a week before it shows he talks about literature search being how an erdos problem was solved...
   1.4. (-5 ⬆️) He's not wrong though. it was "found".

2. (52 ⬆️) Called out by the head of google AI oh man. That is embarrassing

Sure, it was clear. Clearly misleading. 
I fucking hate those non apologies. Like a toddler.

   4.2. (-10 ⬆️) I don't trust him one bit. He is always talking about his own achievements.  

And calling out someone like this is a passive aggressive child move.

5. (7 ⬆️) I dunno I read the original post and the dude didn’t say solved he said the researchers “found” the solution using gpt search. So personally I think people took that the wrong way.

Because honestly that’s kind of a ridiculous way to phrase things. The word found does not just mean found online it means a bunch of ...
   5.3. (3 ⬆️) Except he didn’t just say “found” with no preamble. He explicitly said the era of science being accelerated by ai has begun *because* it found the solutions. 

But that claim only makes sense, and is only noteworthy, if it solved the problems. Otherwise he’s saying that science acceleration starts n...

6. (3 ⬆️) Still substantial, just misrepresented the situation 

7. (2 ⬆️) Not cool. Just deleted my X account.

8. (2 ⬆️) These people are idiots, they desperately want ChatGPT to be something more than good bot for code and to talk to. ChatGPT is not smart, it's good for code and to talk with, it will never reach AGI, this is lie.

   8.1. (0 ⬆️) Smarter than you

9. (2 ⬆️) This is a recurring theme for Bubeck

5. (8 ⬆️) But is the solution actually correct?
   💬 Replies (1):
   5.1. (44 ⬆️) Yes, because it just found people that had done them, just not reported, it didn't invent or discover anything novel, nor did it solve anything.

With a few thousand prompts, it discovered solutions made 20 and more years ago, in short.

6. (8 ⬆️) It was slightly better at googling stuff than a site admin.
   💬 Replies (1):
   6.1. (3 ⬆️) We don't even know if it was better or if the researchers involved just tried longer.  Thousands of queries is a lot.

7. (6 ⬆️) To all who say that it “just” found solutions that had already been published, I want to clarify that mathematical theorems can sometimes be written in very obscure form and it can take lot of insight and understanding to realize you are actually looking at a theorem you need. So unless the papers specifically mention that this is exactly Erdos 408 or whatever, it is still remarkable. Not to mention its value as a search tool.
   💬 Replies (3):
   7.1. (5 ⬆️) This is true, but in this case it found solutions to equations that have been solved.
   7.2. (3 ⬆️) Considering that it took thousands of queries to find 10 solutions, are you sure it's that remarkable?  Are you sure that the same researchers using Google or the right mathematical databases with the same amount of effort wouldn't have found those solutions more quickly?
   7.3. (2 ⬆️) This is stupid. No paper is going to mention that this is "Erdos 408" because this is simply a number assigned by this website which was made something like last year. If you go look at these "newly found solutions", several of them mention Erdos explicitly in the title, one is written by Erdos, and...

8. (4 ⬆️) Chathpt didn’t do shit.  Chaptgpt isn’t a sentient and self-motivated entity that one day decided to go find those answers.

Researchers used a new tool that helped them find the solutions more effectively and mostly by gluing together information that already existed.

1. (193 ⬆️) A technology bubble or a business bubble are two different conversations.

As tech, my opinion is it’s under hyped in the long term

As business, yes these companies are acting crazy- circular investing, throwing billions at incremental progress, investing in data centers that will take years to build, by which time all of the parts of the data center will be obsolete- it’s absurd

   1.3. (8 ⬆️) I would add people starting ai companies with massive funding without any viable product or profits. 

Another concern of mine is that the AIs we see now are subsidized to generate market for the providers. Once prices go up (or consumption is throttled) many businesses will see their foundations cr...
   1.4. (7 ⬆️) Under hyped? You have got to be fucking kidding me. It could literally be no more hyped than it is.
   1.5. (2 ⬆️) One of the best takes I’ve seen.

2. (39 ⬆️) It is a bubble. OpenAI has stated that every service they are running for people loses them money. If we are going to hit a wall with LLMs, investors and funders will not see this as worth funding anymore. IMO with the release of CGPT 5 it’s looking more likely that we’re hitting this wall.
   💬 Replies (5):
   2.1. (4 ⬆️) They’ve already hit the wall and everyone paying attention has noticed. It might take another year before the morons in charge of money-shoveling notice though
   2.2. (2 ⬆️) Isn't this only after accounting for training the next models? Presumably if competition drops because the bubble pops, they would be profitable just serving their current models.
   2.3. (1 ⬆️) So After the bubble pops they'll be profitable because Gen-AI associated costs will have come down creating a compute glut
   2.4. (1 ⬆️) I'll believe in the idea of the wall when we see it. 

So far the pace of AI improvements has been lightyears ahead of any other technology I've ever seen. It's absurdly fast. Within a year we've gone from not being able to count fingers in videos, to being able to create realistic scenes which are ...

3. (25 ⬆️) AI, as a technology, is pretty amazing.  The bubble is from the investors doing crappy and reckless things.  There's no doubt companies are overvalued.  Some companies, which have sketchy business plans, are getting ridiculous money.  There's no way Nvidia is worth $4 trillion.  OpenAI, an unprofitable company, isn't worth $500 billion.

5. (10 ⬆️) The “bubble” is the valuations and “money” used to create those valuations because company A will invest in company B who invests in company C who then uses that money to buy products from company A. Only the first amount of money is “real” and the rest of that money is only real “on paper”. This is similar to how banks loan more money than they have.

These centers consume huge amounts of electricity, forcing utilities to build new power plants (many still fossil-fueled) and upgrade old infrastructure. Those costs are being passed down to consumers, meaning higher bills for the rest of us.  AI might be the future, but it’s burning a lot of power to get there. Do you think this is a fair trade-off or are we all paying the price for Big Tech’s ambitions?

While maybe the cost is being pushed to the consumer, I haven't seen any real indication of that happening, yet.

4. (2 ⬆️) Meh. Datacenter energy is just a few percentage of overall power usage. Ai labs keep spinning that “urgently need all the power” narrative so that they can get exceptions for environmental restrictions.

There is definitely some workflow stuff around reducing costs, but it's very human-in-loop.   The rest I am skeptical about.

10. (1 ⬆️) Once there is a service where I can make my own tv shows/movies I will pay for that.

I’ve been digging into NVIDIA’s rise to $4T and I just never felt really convinced they are worth what they are worth. It's like it's one of those stocks wall street says is supposed to be a juggernaut.  Apple and Amazon have broad ecosystems, but NVIDIA basically bet everything on GPU domination. They nailed the hardware, built a moat with CUDA, rode gaming, crypto, now most notably the AI wave.  But that also means… they live and die by the GPU. No easy pivot. If the AI wave slows, or GPU demand shifts, that could get shaky fast.  I made an analysis breaking down their goal, strategy, and execution, and I respect the hustle, but wouldn't buy into it. Curious what others here think, is this sustainable dominance or a fragile position that could unwind fast? I personally have no stake (short or long) the company, just curious.

can you define "AI"?



pretend that single car that can drive itself has some sort of fancy GPU

pretend every single robot that can perform real world tasks has some sort of fancy GPU



>If the AI wave slows, or GPU demand shifts, that could get shaky fast.

mmmm... can you quantify "fast"? how "soon" is that? months? weeks? years? decades?

   1.1. (-1 ⬆️) Fair... AI isn’t one product, it’s basically compute everywhere. But that’s also the risk: if the “everywhere” hype cools even a bit, it hits their single revenue stream hard. It’s strength and fragility baked in.

2. (3 ⬆️) Nvidia has conquered many domains beyond AI: graphics, filmmaking, gaming, supercomputing, crypto. These markets will still exist even should AI greatly shrink.

3. (3 ⬆️) The stock is inflated, but not by much. This is essentially the second time NVidia made a market to live in. Before NVidia, “Video Cards” were just pixel fill, and if you wanted to do 3D, you needed a 30 thousand dollar SGI computer… a bundled hardware software solution.  
  
My guess is, if/when AI starts to dry up, NVidia will have a new thing to jump to that they’d been incubating, at a loss, for a decade.  
  
4 Trillion is a lot though, and certainly reflects the Stock Market’s tendency to ...

   3.1. (1 ⬆️) 100% agree they’re a beast operationally, that’s why this debate is interesting. Their moat’s real, but so is the concentration risk. If you live by the GPU… well, you know the rest.
   3.2. (-1 ⬆️) nVidia was not the first company offering a affordable 3D video card.

4. (2 ⬆️) i don't see GPU demand dying anytime in our lifetimes.  its only going to get greater
   💬 Replies (1):
   4.1. (1 ⬆️) GPU demand probably won’t die, but valuation depends on growth, not just demand. Even slowing growth can hit hard.

7. (1 ⬆️) People said the same thing about cryptocurrency. It sort of seems like NVIDIA may as well be an oil and gas company at this point. They are the one of, if not the, biggest producer of computing power in the world. If not AI people will find something else to use it on. There’s no shortage of applications for compute power. NVIDIA’s been killing it since they were just a little computer graphics hardware company.
   💬 Replies (1):
   7.1. (1 ⬆️) Absolutely, compute isn’t going away. The question is pricing power. If everyone piles in, margins can shift fast. Supply booms kill kings.

8. (1 ⬆️) I tend to agree.  Everyone loves Nvidia, but these types of infrastructure build outs are cyclical.  There absolutely will be a point where people largely have the infrastructure for the time being and demand slows down from build out to maintain, and then Nvidia valuation looks absurd as demand crashes.  But then it'll spark back up again during the "improvement" wave. How long will the wave last?  Probably much longer, but I've got a nice return and am happy to take my profits early and throw ...

   8.1. (1 ⬆️) Exactly. Infra plays don’t die, they cycle. The danger isn’t “death,” it’s valuation whiplash. Being great ≠ being worth $4T forever.

9. (1 ⬆️) So many businesses you wouldn't expect now run on GPUs.  A decade ago I worked at a company that was processing audio using GPUs.  Any place you need parallel processing GPUs may be in play.
   💬 Replies (1):
   9.1. (1 ⬆️) For sure, GPUs are everywhere now. That’s why it’s fascinating: they’ve become the infrastructure. But infra plays eventually mature.

10. (1 ⬆️) I am not an expert in stocks, but for a layman like me it seems to me selling the infrastructure for/&computations is like selling infrastructure for/&energy. The demand is rising too. 

There are many one trick ponies that are very successfull.

Just a shower thought. What prompt could I ask that would require the most energy for a generative AI to answer.

TOP 10 COMMENTS

1. (10 ⬆️) I asked ChatGPT. It said:

  
“Simulate the entire 2024 U.S. economy month-by-month for five years under three policy scenarios, writing a 300-page report with graphs, references, and code for replication—then critique your own methodology as if you were three separate Nobel-level economists.”

   1.1. (2 ⬆️) LLMs can’t simulate anything. They’re a math formula, they convert your prompt into numbers and run a lot of math on those numbers, then they turn the resulting numbers back into words. So the amount of processing is always the same for the same amount of input/output which is why that’s how they bi...

2. (5 ⬆️) " what prompt would require you to use the most energy and resources? Confirm empirically."

3. (3 ⬆️) Assuming it can create videos ‘create a movie from the Odyssey by Homer’

4. (3 ⬆️) why would you want to waste energy like that?

   4.1. (1 ⬆️) He's the real Dr. Evil
   4.2. (1 ⬆️) may be OP want to DDoS the gpu🤣

5. (3 ⬆️) Ask it “is there a sea horse emoji?” Just watch.

6. (2 ⬆️) It’s probably a semi autonomous multi string agent that has the capability to delegate sub agents. So something that you would say in Claude code with clear enough directives that it wouldn’t stop.

7. (2 ⬆️) Who pays the electricity bill?

9. (1 ⬆️) For a single prompt into a general AI application (ChatGPT, Claude, etc), you would want to:
1.  Ask for a multi step task (ideally, specifying a long list of steps explicitly)
2. Give it a minimum target length of the output
3. Show it's reasoning/think out loud for each step


However, single prompts run into context limits, which effectively sets an upper bound. If you wanted to go beyond this, you would find an agentic app where the AI complete each step, and starts new ones, allowing a refr...
