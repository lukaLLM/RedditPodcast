Post Content:
There might be more bad news about the DGX Spark!  Before it was even released, I told everyone that this thing has a memory bandwidth problem. Although it boasts 1 PFLOPS of FP4 floating-point performance, its memory bandwidth is only 273GB/s. This will cause major stuttering when running large models (with performance being roughly only one-third of a MacStudio M2 Ultra).  Today, more bad news emerged: the floating-point performance doesn't even reach 1 PFLOPS.  Tests from two titans of the industry—John Carmack (founder of id Software, developer of games like Doom, and a name every programmer should know from the legendary fast inverse square root algorithm) and Awni Hannun (the primary lead of Apple's large model framework, MLX)—have shown that this device only achieves 480 TFLOPS of FP4 performance (approximately 60 TFLOPS BF16). That's less than half of the advertised performance.  Furthermore, if you run it for an extended period, it will overheat and restart.  It's currently un...

1. (216 ⬆️) Jesus, not only it costs twice what the AMD version does, it's also has half the claimed performance (probably due to inadequate cooling?)

   1.1. (39 ⬆️) It's actually more like 50% more than a AMD Max+ 395. You have to get the "low spec" version of the Spark though. That being a 1TB PCIe 4 SSD instead of a 4TB PCIe 5 SSD. Considering that some 4TB SSDs have been available for around $200 lately, I think that downgrade is worth saving $1000. So the 1...
   1.2. (4 ⬆️) Which AMD version are you talking about ? It will be super helpful for me, thanks!

2. (105 ⬆️) This is an extreme case of schadenfreude for me. Nvidia has seen astronomical growth in their stock and GPUs over the last 5 years. They have completely dominated the market and charge outrageous prices for their GPUs. 

When it comes to building a standalone AI product, which should be something they should absolutely crush out of the park, they failed miserably. 

Don’t buy this product. Do not support companies that overcharge and underdeliver. Their monopoly needs to die.

For anyone else, this is an expensive disappointment.

   5.1. (32 ⬆️) Unless you need Cuda. It's the Nvidia tax all over again, you have to pay up if you want good developer tooling. The price of the Spark would be worth it if you're counting developer time and ease of use; we plebs using it for local inference aren't part of Nvidia's target market.

7. (30 ⬆️) > a name every programmer should know from the legendary fast inverse square root algorithm

John Carmack didn't invent the fast inverse square root.

Greg Walsh wrote the famous implementation, and he was only one of a line of contributors in its creation going back as far as 1986

https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/e_sqrt.c

/* Other methods (use floating-point arithmetic) ------------- (This is a copy of a drafted paper by Prof W. Kahan and K.C. Ng, written in May, 1986)

   💬 Replies (2):
   7.1. (7 ⬆️) My bad
   7.2. (5 ⬆️) To be fair, it's done slightly differently in his code than fdlibm's implementation.

8. (19 ⬆️) Measured image diffusion generation on DGX Spark was around 3x slower than on 5090. Roughly the level of 3090 which was 568 INT4 dense and 1136 sparse INT4, but had 71 TFLOPs dense BF16 with FP32 accumulate and 142  FP16 TFlops dense with FP16 accumulate. 

So performance is as expected in there. Maybe Spark has the same 2x slowdown with BF16 with FP32 accumulate as 3090 has.
Just pure speculation based on Ampere whitepaper.

Assuming prices don't change much, for the same price as the DGX you can get a M5 Max with over 2x the memory bandwidth for the same price and for 1200 to 1500 more you can get an Ultra with 256 GB mem...

Glyph: Scaling Context Windows via Visual-Text Compression  Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2510.17800  Weights: huggingface.co/zai-org/Glyph  Repo: github.com/thu-coai/Glyph  Glyph is a framework for scaling the context length through visual-text compression. It renders long textual sequences into images and processes them using vision–language models.  This design transforms the challenge of long-context modeling into a multimodal problem, substantially reducing computational and memory costs while preserving semantic information.

4. (2 ⬆️) This is another example of how Chinese companies are aiming for efficiency rather than exquisite capabilities. Increasingly sparse architectures, increase parse/hybrid, attention, mechanisms, and now these different ways of extending context through visual compression.

7. (0 ⬆️) So we're using jpeg compression to compress context now? That's pretty smart


Edit: couldn't find a mention of jpeg in the paper. They might just mean scaling down tokens and words down to single pixels with compression (csn still apply png compression on that while staying lossless I guess but is not specifically mentioned)
   💬 Replies (2):
   7.1. (4 ⬆️) LLMs can't process jpegs directly, they need to be decoded to raw bitmaps which are then encoded into an embedding using a vision encoder

Besides, jpeg is an ancient, obsolete codec.

Webp, avif and jxl achieve significantly lower filesizes while being higher quality
   7.2. (1 ⬆️) Not tokens and words down to *single* pixels, the pixels still need to be arranged in a way that carries information, i.e. in the shape of a letter or word.

Hello guys, hope you're fine.  Short question, I managed to find, working and testing on my PC right now, an A40 48GB. It is passively cooled and it gets quite hot.  [Local testing on my PC](https://preview.redd.it/8az1kqsdyqxf1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=301fff8d7b8d78a3f33c97765bb96ebdeaa03e2d)  The seller (a friend) is asking me 1500USD for it. I'm not from USA, but a 3rd world country.  But I have read here on Local llama that such old cards and such aren't very worth it, also no FP8 support, etc.  So I'm really torn and indecisive about it. For reference, 5090 new goes for about 2700-3300USD (so 32GB, but fp8/fp4 support, like 4x times the bandwidth, etc). Used 4090s are 1600USD. 4090 48GB modded when importing they're about 4200-4400USD. 3090s are 550-600USD.  What would you guys do? Thanks!

1. (100 ⬆️) A40 is still very capable, and will continue to be sp for a few years at least. If you can get it for $1500 without any other hidden fees in working condition, and you can afford it, it's fantastic value. But beware: those cards typically sell well above $5000 ($2000 for 24GB vetsion), so you might be looking at a scam.

   1.2. (-2 ⬆️) They shouldn't be selling for that anymore considering the Blackwell 5000 48gb is superior in every way to the A6000/A40 and is $4500 brand new. 

Even the RTX 6000 Ada/L40S (Ada Lovelace, i.e. 4090-series) is slipping down to ~$5000-5500.

2. (24 ⬆️) It's a nobrainer.

Just buy a fan mount for it, stick on a fan and you are golden.

3. (14 ⬆️) You can't find one cheaper than $4k on eBay.

4. (8 ⬆️) It's an Ampere, basically an RTX A6000 workstation GPU but with no fan.  Roughly equivalent to 3090 Ti. 

$1500 seems like a pretty solid deal to me, though two 3090s would be the alternative option depending on if that is at all practical given your motherboard/case/etc. 

You'll have to get something like a 3D printed fan adapter and figure out how to control the fan.

2. (8 ⬆️) Love the 0.3B (300M) to 0.6B (600M) category

3. (3 ⬆️) The lfm nanos didn't really work for me. Let's see how this goes

4. (3 ⬆️) Is there a plan to update Granite’s training data to have a more recent knowledge cut off?

5. (2 ⬆️) Wow, those IFEval scores are really impressive for a 1B.

6. (1 ⬆️) Only 16 heads :'c

But gonna give it a shot vs old 2b. I hope it will be able to learn to the same level while being 30% smaller.

7. (1 ⬆️) Will your upcoming vision models be good at providing bounding box coordinates to identify objects in an image?

8. (1 ⬆️) The Granite Tiny is pretty good for use with web search MCP in LM studio, it's my go to for that and it does better than some Qwen models. Haven't tried Nano yet, tempted, maybe I should :)

   8.1. (2 ⬆️) Better than Qwen in what ways? 

I want to use Tiny over Qwen3 4B as my default for web search on iOS, but I still haven’t found a system prompt to make Tiny to format sources consistently just yet.

Of my comprehension.
   💬 Replies (2):
   1.1. (8 ⬆️) Who knows.. but i’m sure he’ll get the offer if he applies for it.

At present, best thing we can do is support him.
   1.2. (1 ⬆️) For what? Apple tries to make micro LLM (3-4b), what will be good on the all their devices. Yes, they are failing, but It's different directions.

2. (3 ⬆️) tf do you mean 123 pp, 49 tg  
  
Yeah I know prompt processing is a little bit low, but the token generation tho.  
  
What kind of wizardry is this? 👁
   💬 Replies (3):
   2.1. (4 ⬆️) It's about what you'd expect, a 22b at 4bit gets 26 or 27 tok/s on mlx and this is a 10b so it's in the right ballpark.
   2.2. (2 ⬆️)  > Yeah I know prompt processing is a little bit low

I don't think that the reported pp is accurate. If you look closer, it only processed 23 tokens. To get a better pp reading, it would be necessary to run it over a bigger prompt.

> What kind of wizardry is this?

10B active parameters, so it is ...
   2.3. (1 ⬆️) this is not surprising, but the PP speed is slower than other 100B models. I think they will have to optimize it and it will likely be faster in next commit

3. (1 ⬆️) If someone connects 3 M3 ultra machines together, will it able to produce more than 100tk/s with 50% context windows.  
Or for something like GLM 4.6 will it be able to run at a decent speed?

I do feel that bandwidth is the bottle neck, but if you know who did it, please mention.
   💬 Replies (2):
   3.1. (3 ⬆️) you're right - bandwidth is the bottleneck for a lot of this, so chaining together is not going to make things any faster. It would technically allow you to run larger or higher quant models, but I don't think that's very worth it over just having the single 512GB model.
   3.2. (1 ⬆️) Someone already did this to run deepseek at q8, they got like 10 tokens per second. It’s on youtube somewhere.

4. (1 ⬆️) Is it possible to run with 64GB RAM on an M3 Max?
   💬 Replies (2):

1. (12 ⬆️) Summary:
1. TTS: Kokoro is still king, Vibevoice is awesome but super large in comparison.

   2.3. (2 ⬆️) For real-time subtitle generation, kyutai stt is actually quite decent for English. I think for streaming and self-hosting that's the best reliable option that also provides a sort of easy to implement timestamping logic.
   2.4. (2 ⬆️) This has not changed in a while. Parakeet V2 (english) and V3 (multilingual) with the fast conformer from Nvidia are the best models available, although other Nvidia models like canary-1b-v2 seem very promising, I can’t get it ported to mlx or gguf and nvidia is curiously stubborn about porting thei...

   7.2. (3 ⬆️) Vibevoice (specifically the 7B model) is surprisingly good.

It has pretty decent inflection and emotion.  
Outputs can be a bit wonky at times though, but I'm just going to chalk that down to not having the settings dialed in yet.
   7.3. (2 ⬆️) I use piper. The voice quality is pretty poor, but piper is extremely fast and resource-efficient. Low latency is very important to me, and piper can even run at a decent speed on a Raspberry Pi. And unlike kokoro, piper offers a bunch of non-English voices. Since I'm primarily interested in German ...
   7.4. (1 ⬆️) Vibevoice is really amazing, but large. It can clone very well and sounds more realistic than kyutai or kokoro
   7.5. (1 ⬆️) Index-tts V2 hands down. If you are fine with slower model Xtts V2 is still pretty good. If you don't need voice cloning go with kokoro.

And yet, people still don't believe there's anything beyond Parakeet and Whisper. They don't believe that anyone other than big players like Nvidia and OpenAI can create an ASR model that's truly efficient, and perhaps even better in some areas (edge devices), than Parakeet and Whisper, and has just a fraction of weights of them.

   1.2. (19 ⬆️) If you click the fork button on Github you violate their license terms and open yourself up to being sued. Absolutely not even close to OSS.

   2.1. (1 ⬆️) I have not heard of librechat before.  Thanks for pointing it out.

3. (8 ⬆️) What we really need is an Open WebUI alternative that doesn't require docker/python bs; give me some clean simple installer for MacOS/Windows like LM Studio.
   💬 Replies (4):
   3.1. (4 ⬆️) This is my biggest issue with most of these, I don't feel like installing Docker (on Windows at least it's very annoying).
   3.2. (2 ⬆️) And it has to be native build, not a 1.2Gb RAM electron (or the likes) app like Jan.
   3.3. (1 ⬆️) \+32K
   3.4. (1 ⬆️) You don't actually need docker, it's just the safest way if you're deploying for multiple users. Installation is as little as 1 line (assuming no environment conflicts), and 4 if you need need a separate python environment (a good idea in most cases).

I have the super basic update and launch script...

4. (5 ⬆️) I starred the repo because I am interested in supporting this work and also to give you a small win for putting up with the comments here

There is a lot of whitespace still in the client applications and I support more choice beyond Open WebUI. WebUI has its place but it’s not for everyone.

We have had a need for a much lighter client application that can connect to OpenAI-compatible endpoints so your single-file contribution is well received here.

Thank you

5. (2 ⬆️) I understand OWUI is only "semi" OSS, but I much rather continue to use that. As an OWUI user, I can confidently pull the docker image and get a few changes every few weeks because I know that OWUI is a mature, well-maintained repository with a key, active maintainer and several contributors continually working on it, fixing bugs, adding new features, etc. It has lots of features, many of which are well-documented.

7. (1 ⬆️) I like that there are options other than owui, but without any form of tool calling / MCP it's not really a viable alternative for many folks. However I do like the clean command-line client, that's pretty rad.

   1.1. (13 ⬆️) I think this article was written by some AI that's why it sounds that way.
   1.2. (6 ⬆️) When you do something really cool, its ok to boast a bit. Feel like people are getting hung up on the author not being humble enough, but there's something potentially great here.
   1.3. (5 ⬆️) Considering the pay level of AI engineers, yeah. This is just a form of self-promotion to get hired.

6. (5 ⬆️) MoBA seems similar to this work - https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoBA

but it's prefill only, and decode is using full attention.

All signs suggest that this was tried and has shortcomings which author is unaware of. Plenty of things work on toy problems but not on bigger ones.

   1.2. (6 ⬆️) There was literally a California law that required this
   1.3. (5 ⬆️) is sharing such data breaking privacy? 

porn sites tell you the most popular videos but they don't share who's watched them.
   1.4. (1 ⬆️) I don’t think that’s exactly the same but yeah it is not very pleasant

2. (20 ⬆️) In spite of the bad press, talking to AI about mental health problems including depression (and I suppose suicide), can be very helpful. It is safer if they aren't sycophantic, and aren't super obedient / instruct tuned, but it's pretty good either way.

   2.1. (6 ⬆️) You can’t even talk to a therapist about killing yourself because they are obligated to report and you’ll end up in a ward for a couple days. I have thought about this before but I knew not to be completely honest with my therapist because of this.
   2.2. (6 ⬆️) Furthermore it's not always self ideation. Many people are impacted by this through the poeple they know who struggle with it.


I don't think we should be encouraging AI to fill certain roles, but forbidden topics don't really accomplish much.

I mean, ChatGPT will accept that you are current...

   3.2. (8 ⬆️) That around 1-2% of people think about suicide? I think that has always been the case and is about a normal %.

4. (6 ⬆️) Well, when considering the neglect of mental health provider access, then this becomes obvious.

5. (2 ⬆️) Not a surprise.

6. (2 ⬆️) It's not surprising and it's honestly not the only private or disturbing thing that people would talk about with an AI. For whatever its flaws, it's "relatively" judgement free and the placation and glazzing that typically galls us so much, might actually uplift some people from dark places.

The family of Adam Raine, who died by suicide in April 2025, alleges that OpenAI deliberately weakened safety protocols just months before his death. According to court documents, Raine's ChatGPT usage skyrocketed from dozens of daily conversations in January to over 300 by April, with self-harm content increasing from 1.6% to 17% of his messages.  "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times, six times more than Adam himself did," the lawsuit states. The family claims OpenAI's systems flagged 377 messages for self-harm content yet allowed conversations to continue.​  State attorneys general from California and Delaware have warned OpenAI it must better protect young users, threatening to block the company's planned corporate restructuring.

Amazon plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs—its largest layoffs in years—explicitly to invest in AI. HR chief Beth Galetti called AI "the most transformative technology since the internet," while CEO Andy Jassy warned months ago that the company would need "fewer people" as AI drives efficiency.  This isn't just Amazon's story; it's a warning. White-collar roles once seen as safe are vanishing first, replaced by systems that prioritize speed over human judgment. The result? Growing unemployment, skill gaps, and dangerous over-reliance on AI.

But let's say it's because of AI so it sounds better

8. (5 ⬆️) The thing to watch is how much AI are they using? By AI mean Actually Indians. Many of these layoffs see Tata or Infosys moving in. Keep in mind that US courts have said paying an H1B 30% less than prevailing wage is NOT considered negatively impacting wages.

9. (4 ⬆️) This is what will continue to happen as long as tech billionaires are running the country.  AI will rapidly take jobs from people and the company won’t subsidize basic living income, because that kills profit.  The economy can’t handle AI progression to taking jobs while the system is in a full capitalism mode, the few who control the majority of business will look for profit before all else and this will ruin people, change is needed.

1. (21 ⬆️) This is a "Once in humanity's existence" event.

We either get this right, and things become awesome.

Or we get it wrong, and this is our swan song.

   1.1. (14 ⬆️) It will be like all new tech, progress will come in fits and spurts, there will be setbacks and dead-ends, it will take longer than expected, there will be competing approaches, etc.  It's not a single thing that we get right or wrong.
   1.2. (2 ⬆️) Nope. The tech is in its infancy and break more then crate in places. But one thing it's created for sure is a huge financial bubble, that also translates in extremely power hungry datacenters playing strongly against CO2 reductuon plans.
   1.3. (1 ⬆️) Very well said,seems like a pillar arrangement for our whole house(life structure)

2. (10 ⬆️) And people think the AI bubble will burst, lol. 

Governments want AI to automate their economies, and they will spend trillions to have data centres built in their countries. They aren’t going to sit back and watch an issue of private monetary and profit halt production and therefore also adoption of AI within their economies.

The idea that Nvidia will be reducing its production of chips, companies such as open AI will be scraping plans to build data centres, because the sector is unable to ex...

   2.1. (9 ⬆️) This does not mean the AI bubble won’t pop. Economically illiterate people often correlate AI bubble popping to AI advancement ceasing.
   2.2. (2 ⬆️) Where do these governments get the trillions that they're pumping into creating AI infrastructure from?
   2.3. (1 ⬆️) Governments don’t just have unlimited money.. especially if their economy is automated and all their workers are out of work. No more taxes means no more money. Right now we can at least print fiat currency backed by labor and taxes and stuff.. but then what? We’ll print currency backed truly by not...
   2.4. (1 ⬆️) AI can be an amazingly transformative technology and a bubble at the same time. 

Yes, I believe AI has amazing use cases and capabilities. No, I do not think the market is pricing it right, and I have concerns about various circular deals on wild expectations of future revenue.
   2.5. (1 ⬆️) It is not clear right now that having larger infrastructure actually enhance AI. It has been pointed out that smaller companys as Deepseek and Mistral are able to build LLM models as efficient as open AI  6 monthes to a year after those large companies with a very small fraction of their asset. So t...

3. (3 ⬆️) Plopping a data center somewhere doesn’t enrich the local population. Sure you get a good amount of jobs for a couple of years and then you’re just pouring electricity and water into it, and the profit is going to the companies extracting wealth out of it’s usage. Sure whoever owns the place will get money for leasing out compute I guess but you aren’t giving this money out to everybody on the local population. Unless I’m missing something here all the local population gets so far is less water ...

4. (2 ⬆️) FOMO is human nature. It's like crypto, only bigger.

5. (2 ⬆️) I am worried about Jakarta's electricity grid and water supply, lol. I think this is more about finding cheaper land and resources for big multinational corp to plant their datacenter rather than Indonesian seeking any kind of AI sovereignty whatsoever. The datacenters will be owned by foreign firm serving foreign customer. No doubt about that.

2. (8 ⬆️) power, control, surveillance

3. (8 ⬆️) Almost all Silicon Valley companies try to do the same thing - pick a market, find a way to insert themselves as a gateway middleman, and begin charging rent. Uber, DoorDash, even Amazon. 
The crazy thing is, the market for ai is almost any white collar job, as well as any blue collar job with repeatable steps and processes. That’s a lot of markets/jobs. If they can insert themselves as gateway middlemen into essentially ‘everything’ and begin charging rent , that is the ultimate goal.

Perfect description of what the US has become (rent seekers) and we are shocked that China can build 6 nuclear reactors in 1 year.

4. (4 ⬆️) AI as a service subscription income.

5. (3 ⬆️) AI is a big field and there are many focus areas.  There is neuromorphic computer, binary neural networks, symbolic AI, and further research into LLMs.

And AGI has many theories and strategies like combining transformers with symbolic AI.  Or things like HTM or Hierarchical Temporal Memory.  Neuromorphic computer has SDTP ( spike dependent temporal plasticity) which is continually train or on chip learning

7. (3 ⬆️) Honestly, I think the **goal of AI research** really depends on *who you ask.*

* **Big tech companies** are chasing scale and control - building foundation models they can license, integrate, and monetize across everything from cloud to consumer tools.
* **Researchers** are focused on understanding general intelligence - alignment, reasoning, and autonomy.
* **Startups (and solo builders)** are working to *productize AI -* turning models into workflows that actually make people’s lives easier.

8. (2 ⬆️) There are 3 different goals from 3 sectors 1: Academia/ Research, 2: Company/ Capitalism & 3: Military.  
1 Academia: help expand science & speed up human & tech advancement, for the better of humanity  
2 Company: replace human labor, increase profit & market domination  
3 Military: fight & win wars without human cost

9. (2 ⬆️) middlemen rats, and the people who push planned obsolescence when we could have abundance and stability the greedy continue to ruin our lives. People are starting to wake up and realize the cloud is a lie some of the ai companies will push robots and eventually destroy old world capital hopefully ending all currency. For now we must suffer as old money continues to be a rat middleman and resell things that would be cheaper to run locally if nvidia would just sell high memory gpus to people and l...

Hey there! I’ve been reading a [recent study](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/talk-trust-and-trade-offs_2025_web.pdf) and I’m worried about what’s happening with teens online. The report finds most platforms still lack age verification and important safety guardrails, and they’re designed to keep them engaged through constant validation and agreement - which can seriously mess with emotional development.  Just take a sec and look at this:  * About 72% of U.S. teens have used chatbots designed to feel like friends and 52% use them regularly. * One in three of those teens say they choose to talk to an AI instead of a real person for serious stuff. * Around 24% of them have shared real personal info (name, location, secrets) with these AI systems.

And GenZ with the AI psychosis was no surprise because previous generations have offered them up as the first in line sacrifice for AI replacement.

Fuck.

4. (5 ⬆️) I think it's a bit sad that AI makes better confident then other humans. Might be a human problem not aa machine problem though. 

I remember high school as a place where the confident douches and the pretty girls were the most popular, humans can be ethically and morally deficient in social context. Might be why some choose to confide with a machine. 

Not saying there ain't issues with the point you're making but truly, many people are horrible persons.

Doesn't matter, teenagers are going to teenage - then they'll learn to adult in their own generational way.

9. (-2 ⬆️) Feh.

In the 1950s, some goofballs were running around claiming that comic books were a danger to children. 

About 2500 years ago, Socrates was arrested and then executed for that very thing.

A new definitive agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI will now allow the former to independently pursue AGI or in partnership with third parties. The companies announced that they've signed a new definitive agreement as the multibillion-dollar partnership enters the next phase. The new agreement paints a clear picture of Microsoft's stand and view about OpenAI's transition into a for-profit entity.[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-wont-sever-its-ties-with-microsoft-even-after-declaring-agi)  [https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-wont-sever-its-ties-with-microsoft-even-after-declaring-agi](https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-wont-sever-its-ties-with-microsoft-even-after-declaring-agi)

1. (2 ⬆️) Looks like a beautiful prenup! 
What do we have? Guaranteed AGI lol

2. (2 ⬆️) The only reason this is important is because they have the term "AGI" in their contract. I think Microsoft signed that one expecting it to never happen, but OpenAI has their own little special definition of what exactly that means. They've been negotiating this for a while. Last go around OpenAI wanted it to be "once it makes a $100 billion dollars in revenue". 

Now they've agreed someone else gets to decide what it means. 

Pretty forgiving of OpenAI, you know, considering the attempted coup.
