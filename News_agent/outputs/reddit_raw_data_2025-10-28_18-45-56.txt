There might be more bad news about the DGX Spark!  Before it was even released, I told everyone that this thing has a memory bandwidth problem. Although it boasts 1 PFLOPS of FP4 floating-point performance, its memory bandwidth is only 273GB/s. This will cause major stuttering when running large models (with performance being roughly only one-third of a MacStudio M2 Ultra).  Today, more bad news emerged: the floating-point performance doesn't even reach 1 PFLOPS.  Tests from two titans of the industry‚ÄîJohn Carmack (founder of id Software, developer of games like Doom, and a name every programmer should know from the legendary fast inverse square root algorithm) and Awni Hannun (the primary lead of Apple's large model framework, MLX)‚Äîhave shown that this device only achieves 480 TFLOPS of FP4 performance (approximately 60 TFLOPS BF16). That's less than half of the advertised performance.  Furthermore, if you run it for an extended period, it will overheat and restart.  It's currently un...

   1.1. (39 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's actually more like 50% more than a AMD Max+ 395. You have to get the "low spec" version of the Spark though. That being a 1TB PCIe 4 SSD instead of a 4TB PCIe 5 SSD. Considering that some 4TB SSDs have been available for around $200 lately, I think that downgrade is worth saving $1000. So the 1...

2. (105 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) This is an extreme case of schadenfreude for me. Nvidia has seen astronomical growth in their stock and GPUs over the last 5 years. They have completely dominated the market and charge outrageous prices for their GPUs. 

When it comes to building a standalone AI product, which should be something they should absolutely crush out of the park, they failed miserably.

7. (30 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) > a name every programmer should know from the legendary fast inverse square root algorithm

John Carmack didn't invent the fast inverse square root.

Greg Walsh wrote the famous implementation, and he was only one of a line of contributors in its creation going back as far as 1986

https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/e_sqrt.c

   7.1. (7 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) My bad
   7.2. (5 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) To be fair, it's done slightly differently in his code than fdlibm's implementation.

8. (19 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Measured image diffusion generation on DGX Spark was around 3x slower than on 5090. Roughly the level of 3090 which was 568 INT4 dense and 1136 sparse INT4, but had 71 TFLOPs dense BF16 with FP32 accumulate and 142  FP16 TFlops dense with FP16 accumulate. 

So performance is as expected in there. Maybe Spark has the same 2x slowdown with BF16 with FP32 accumulate as 3090 has.
Just pure speculation based on Ampere whitepaper.

Glyph: Scaling Context Windows via Visual-Text Compression  Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2510.17800  Weights: huggingface.co/zai-org/Glyph  Repo: github.com/thu-coai/Glyph  Glyph is a framework for scaling the context length through visual-text compression. It renders long textual sequences into images and processes them using vision‚Äìlanguage models.  This design transforms the challenge of long-context modeling into a multimodal problem, substantially reducing computational and memory costs while preserving semantic information.

4. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) This is another example of how Chinese companies are aiming for efficiency rather than exquisite capabilities. Increasingly sparse architectures, increase parse/hybrid, attention, mechanisms, and now these different ways of extending context through visual compression.

7. (0 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) So we're using jpeg compression to compress context now? That's pretty smart


Edit: couldn't find a mention of jpeg in the paper. They might just mean scaling down tokens and words down to single pixels with compression (csn still apply png compression on that while staying lossless I guess but is not specifically mentioned)
   üí¨ Replies (2):
   7.1. (4 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) LLMs can't process jpegs directly, they need to be decoded to raw bitmaps which are then encoded into an embedding using a vision encoder

Besides, jpeg is an ancient, obsolete codec.

Webp, avif and jxl achieve significantly lower filesizes while being higher quality
   7.2. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Not tokens and words down to *single* pixels, the pixels still need to be arranged in a way that carries information, i.e. in the shape of a letter or word.

Hello guys, hope you're fine.  Short question, I managed to find, working and testing on my PC right now, an A40 48GB. It is passively cooled and it gets quite hot.  [Local testing on my PC](https://preview.redd.it/8az1kqsdyqxf1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=301fff8d7b8d78a3f33c97765bb96ebdeaa03e2d)  The seller (a friend) is asking me 1500USD for it. I'm not from USA, but a 3rd world country.  But I have read here on Local llama that such old cards and such aren't very worth it, also no FP8 support, etc.  So I'm really torn and indecisive about it. For reference, 5090 new goes for about 2700-3300USD (so 32GB, but fp8/fp4 support, like 4x times the bandwidth, etc). Used 4090s are 1600USD. 4090 48GB modded when importing they're about 4200-4400USD. 3090s are 550-600USD.  What would you guys do? Thanks!

1. (100 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) A40 is still very capable, and will continue to be sp for a few years at least. If you can get it for $1500 without any other hidden fees in working condition, and you can afford it, it's fantastic value. But beware: those cards typically sell well above $5000 ($2000 for 24GB vetsion), so you might be looking at a scam.

Aw man I'm still debating about it...
   1.2. (-2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) They shouldn't be selling for that anymore considering the Blackwell 5000 48gb is superior in every way to the A6000/A40 and is $4500 brand new. 

Even the RTX 6000 Ada/L40S (Ada Lovelace, i.e. 4090-series) is slipping down to ~$5000-5500.

2. (24 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's a nobrainer.

Just buy a fan mount for it, stick on a fan and you are golden.

3. (14 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) You can't find one cheaper than $4k on eBay.

4. (8 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's an Ampere, basically an RTX A6000 workstation GPU but with no fan.  Roughly equivalent to 3090 Ti. 

$1500 seems like a pretty solid deal to me, though two 3090s would be the alternative option depending on if that is at all practical given your motherboard/case/etc. 

You'll have to get something like a 3D printed fan adapter and figure out how to control the fan.

   1.1. (13 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Hello IBM, I have a question - what about bigger models? Like 70B or something :)
   1.2. (5 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Do you guys have a reasoning model in the pipeline?
   1.3. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Any plans to release Granite 4 versions of the RAG/Security LoRAs that you guys have for Granite 3.3?
   1.4. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) the granite 1B model is closer to 2 billion params?
   1.5. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Is this tuned for tools use? 
What else we expect?

2. (8 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Love the 0.3B (300M) to 0.6B (600M) category

3. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The lfm nanos didn't really work for me. Let's see how this goes

4. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Is there a plan to update Granite‚Äôs training data to have a more recent knowledge cut off?

5. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Wow, those IFEval scores are really impressive for a 1B.

6. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Only 16 heads :'c

But gonna give it a shot vs old 2b. I hope it will be able to learn to the same level while being 30% smaller.

7. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Will your upcoming vision models be good at providing bounding box coordinates to identify objects in an image?

8. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The Granite Tiny is pretty good for use with web search MCP in LM studio, it's my go to for that and it does better than some Qwen models. Haven't tried Nano yet, tempted, maybe I should :)

Of my comprehension.

   1.1. (8 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Who knows.. but i‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll get the offer if he applies for it.

At present, best thing we can do is support him.
   1.2. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) For what? Apple tries to make micro LLM (3-4b), what will be good on the all their devices. Yes, they are failing, but It's different directions.

2. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) tf do you mean 123 pp, 49 tg  
  
Yeah I know prompt processing is a little bit low, but the token generation tho.  
  
What kind of wizardry is this? üëÅ
   üí¨ Replies (3):
   2.1. (4 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's about what you'd expect, a 22b at 4bit gets 26 or 27 tok/s on mlx and this is a 10b so it's in the right ballpark.
   2.2. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è)  > Yeah I know prompt processing is a little bit low

I don't think that the reported pp is accurate. If you look closer, it only processed 23 tokens. To get a better pp reading, it would be necessary to run it over a bigger prompt.

> What kind of wizardry is this?

10B active parameters, so it is ...
   2.3. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) this is not surprising, but the PP speed is slower than other 100B models. I think they will have to optimize it and it will likely be faster in next commit

3. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) If someone connects 3 M3 ultra machines together, will it able to produce more than 100tk/s with 50% context windows.  
Or for something like GLM 4.6 will it be able to run at a decent speed?

I do feel that bandwidth is the bottle neck, but if you know who did it, please mention.
   üí¨ Replies (2):
   3.1. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) you're right - bandwidth is the bottleneck for a lot of this, so chaining together is not going to make things any faster. It would technically allow you to run larger or higher quant models, but I don't think that's very worth it over just having the single 512GB model.
   3.2. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Someone already did this to run deepseek at q8, they got like 10 tokens per second. It‚Äôs on youtube somewhere.

4. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Is it possible to run with 64GB RAM on an M3 Max?
   üí¨ Replies (2):

   2.3. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) For real-time subtitle generation, kyutai stt is actually quite decent for English. I think for streaming and self-hosting that's the best reliable option that also provides a sort of easy to implement timestamping logic.
   2.4. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) This has not changed in a while.

   7.2. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Vibevoice (specifically the 7B model) is surprisingly good.

It has pretty decent inflection and emotion.  
Outputs can be a bit wonky at times though, but I'm just going to chalk that down to not having the settings dialed in yet.
   7.3. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I use piper. The voice quality is pretty poor, but piper is extremely fast and resource-efficient. Low latency is very important to me, and piper can even run at a decent speed on a Raspberry Pi. And unlike kokoro, piper offers a bunch of non-English voices.

4. (5 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I starred the repo because I am interested in supporting this work and also to give you a small win for putting up with the comments here

There is a lot of whitespace still in the client applications and I support more choice beyond Open WebUI. WebUI has its place but it‚Äôs not for everyone.

We have had a need for a much lighter client application that can connect to OpenAI-compatible endpoints so your single-file contribution is well received here.

Thank you

5. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I understand OWUI is only "semi" OSS, but I much rather continue to use that. As an OWUI user, I can confidently pull the docker image and get a few changes every few weeks because I know that OWUI is a mature, well-maintained repository with a key, active maintainer and several contributors continually working on it, fixing bugs, adding new features, etc. It has lots of features, many of which are well-documented.

1. (56 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) There‚Äôs that privacy they talked about
   üí¨ Replies (4):
   1.1. (50 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) You know you can have anonymity while retaining statistics, right?

This is not the gotcha you think it is.
   1.2. (6 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) There was literally a California law that required this
   1.3. (5 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) is sharing such data breaking privacy? 

porn sites tell you the most popular videos but they don't share who's watched them.
   1.4. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs exactly the same but yeah it is not very pleasant

2. (20 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) In spite of the bad press, talking to AI about mental health problems including depression (and I suppose suicide), can be very helpful. It is safer if they aren't sycophantic, and aren't super obedient / instruct tuned, but it's pretty good either way.
   üí¨ Replies (5):
   2.1. (6 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) You can‚Äôt even talk to a therapist about killing yourself because they are obligated to report and you‚Äôll end up in a ward for a couple days. I have thought about this before but I knew not to be completely honest with my therapist because of this.
   2.2. (6 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Furthermore it's not always self ideation. Many people are impacted by this through the poeple they know who struggle with it.


I don't think we should be encouraging AI to fill certain roles, but forbidden topics don't really accomplish much.


I remember wanting to discuss a hypothetical in which...
   2.3. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I talk to it about xuicide all the time and it's always been cautious and conscientious about it.  I generally get into the philosophical domains though, like discussing Camus
   2.4. (0 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The problem is that you can frame reality, ethics, and morality for them and they will base all of their advice on this framing. You might not even realize you're doing it. Unlike a real therapist, they have no firm boundaries or objective thoughts. 

I mean, ChatGPT will accept that you are current...
   2.5. (-1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) No, it‚Äôs awful. ChatGPT has cooked your brain

3. (15 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) What does that say about the current state of the world‚Ä¶
   üí¨ Replies (2):
   3.1. (12 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I guess it tells us that we do not have an effective treatment for most mental health problems and chat bots seem to provide some need for depressed people.
   3.2. (8 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) That around 1-2% of people think about suicide? I think that has always been the case and is about a normal %.

4. (6 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Well, when considering the neglect of mental health provider access, then this becomes obvious.

5. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Not a surprise.

6. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's not surprising and it's honestly not the only private or disturbing thing that people would talk about with an AI. For whatever its flaws, it's "relatively" judgement free and the placation and glazzing that typically galls us so much, might actually uplift some people from dark places.

7. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Privacy used to be valued

8. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) That‚Äôs just scratching the surface. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre tired boss‚Äù is an understatement

9. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) that's becuase the united slums don't mental health

The family of Adam Raine, who died by suicide in April 2025, alleges that OpenAI deliberately weakened safety protocols just months before his death. According to court documents, Raine's ChatGPT usage skyrocketed from dozens of daily conversations in January to over 300 by April, with self-harm content increasing from 1.6% to 17% of his messages.  "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times, six times more than Adam himself did," the lawsuit states. The family claims OpenAI's systems flagged 377 messages for self-harm content yet allowed conversations to continue.‚Äã  State attorneys general from California and Delaware have warned OpenAI it must better protect young users, threatening to block the company's planned corporate restructuring.

   2.5. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I am willing to bet their data probably flags suicidal considerations as much as 10 times as often as it actually appears. I have gotten that notice like a dozen times. I have never once talked to it about feeling suicidal (I have never felt suicidal).

3. (64 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's ridiculous at this point. Because it's easy to blame a tool instead of blaming yourself for missing out on your kid's mental health. The tool has no accountability, people have, you can blame a rope or a person who sold him the rope all the same but that won't give you much money ofc.

Amazon plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs‚Äîits largest layoffs in years‚Äîexplicitly to invest in AI. HR chief Beth Galetti called AI "the most transformative technology since the internet," while CEO Andy Jassy warned months ago that the company would need "fewer people" as AI drives efficiency.  This isn't just Amazon's story; it's a warning. White-collar roles once seen as safe are vanishing first, replaced by systems that prioritize speed over human judgment. The result? Growing unemployment, skill gaps, and dangerous over-reliance on AI.

   1.2. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Nope. The tech is in its infancy and break more then crate in places. But one thing it's created for sure is a huge financial bubble, that also translates in extremely power hungry datacenters playing strongly against CO2 reductuon plans.

I think this is more about finding cheaper land and resources for big multinational corp to plant their datacenter rather than Indonesian seeking any kind of AI sovereignty whatsoever. The datacenters will be owned by foreign firm serving foreign customer. No doubt about that.

The crazy thing is, the market for ai is almost any white collar job, as well as any blue collar job with repeatable steps and processes. That‚Äôs a lot of markets/jobs.

The report finds most platforms still lack age verification and important safety guardrails, and they‚Äôre designed to keep them engaged through constant validation and agreement - which can seriously mess with emotional development.  Just take a sec and look at this:  * About 72% of U.S. teens have used chatbots designed to feel like friends and 52% use them regularly. * One in three of those teens say they choose to talk to an AI instead of a real person for serious stuff. * Around 24% of them have shared real personal info (name, location, secrets) with these AI systems.

1. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Looks like a beautiful prenup! 
What do we have? Guaranteed AGI lol

2. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The only reason this is important is because they have the term "AGI" in their contract. I think Microsoft signed that one expecting it to never happen, but OpenAI has their own little special definition of what exactly that means. They've been negotiating this for a while. Last go around OpenAI wanted it to be "once it makes a $100 billion dollars in revenue". 

Now they've agreed someone else gets to decide what it means. 

Pretty forgiving of OpenAI, you know, considering the attempted coup.
