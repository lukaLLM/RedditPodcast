A massive shout-out to the vLLM team for being the heroes holding it all together so we can actually run all these amazing new models.  And, of course, a huge thank you to all the open-source teams like DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, and so many others. You are all pushing the entire field forward.

1. (120 ⬆️) Adding another huge thank you to the **llama.cpp** team as well!

Thanks to their incredible optimization and compatibility, they've made open-source models accessible to everyone, especially those of us who are GPU poor

   1.1. (39 ⬆️) Meanwhile ollama is taking orders and pretending to be the chef.
   1.2. (18 ⬆️) I was going to roast ollama, but someone was faster than me

2. (41 ⬆️) It's almost a full time job to even *try* new models. Between text/image/video/etc. 

Being OSS, at least they have outside contributors.

   3.3. (1 ⬆️) Id wager it's more of a power play against the US who is leveraged to the tits purely on software. Meanwhile China can sabotage the software industry and still get their's with their decades of unprecedented investment in manufacturing behind their back thereby solidifying their global economic stre...

4. (15 ⬆️) They need to make vLLM as easy to use as llama.cpp
   💬 Replies (2):
   4.1. (4 ⬆️) 💯 From a dual GPU (3090 eGPU and Strix Halo) perspective, vllm installation on the gfx1151 side has been one of the more hair pullingly frustrating experiences in recent memory. This is probably more on AMD but still. If someone has a pointer to something that “just works” it’d be awesome
   4.2. (1 ⬆️) What's so difficult about it?

5. (8 ⬆️) Ok but don’t forget about MLX team, with zero day support for most local models, months before qwen GGUFs are available!

6. (2 ⬆️) they buried the streaming end to end   code for omni though
   💬 Replies (1):
   6.1. (2 ⬆️) Too hard to write lol


I had a go too

7. (2 ⬆️) If only they didn't arbitrarily explicitly disable older cuda versions like for the Nvidia P40 cards which are kings of VRAM per dollar.

I can understand if that cuda versions missing something critical, but people have been able to undo that check and have vllm run totally fine.

2. (43 ⬆️) Even though it's closed weight, I'm hoping it beats the big US proprietary models just to see the fallout.

   2.1. (12 ⬆️) Considering how good normal Max is, this could compete with the top end of proprietary models
   2.2. (3 ⬆️) It won't beat them.

If not local, please discuss elsewhere.

   3.1. (15 ⬆️) It would be great if Qwen3-Max-Thinking was open weight, but even if it wasn't, it would still be an interesting research artifact, since some next-generation Qwen models might be distilled from it, or it might be used to generate synthetic data for training other Qwen models.
   3.2. (0 ⬆️) They upvote anything from China. Some of them are Chinese bots, some of them just hate the west and some of them just hype benchmarks.

7. (3 ⬆️) This shit isn't local. It's in the cloud, restricted to one provider. Treat it like you treat all other cloud LLMs that don't respect your privacy.

8. (2 ⬆️) I wish we had sub 200B qwen coder model.
480B is too big.

1. (84 ⬆️) Let us know if you have any questions about these models!

Get more details in our blog → [https://ibm.biz/BdbyGk](https://ibm.biz/BdbyGk)
   💬 Replies (5):
   1.1. (31 ⬆️) Hello IBM, I have a question - what about bigger models? Like 70B or something :)
   1.2. (16 ⬆️) Do you guys have a reasoning model in the pipeline?
   1.3. (8 ⬆️) the granite 1B model is closer to 2 billion params?
   1.4. (8 ⬆️) Any plans to release Granite 4 versions of the RAG/Security LoRAs that you guys have for Granite 3.3?
   1.5. (5 ⬆️) Hey these are really cool! What does the Granite team envision as some great use cases of these models? What level of workload can they realistically handle?

I'd love to start incorporating these into my daily workflows, and would love to know what I can expect as I am building those out. Thank you...

2. (21 ⬆️) Love the 0.3B (300M) to 0.6B (600M) category
   💬 Replies (1):
   2.1. (9 ⬆️) We do too! What do you primarily use models of this size for?

3. (11 ⬆️) The lfm nanos didn't really work for me. Let's see how this goes

4. (9 ⬆️) The Granite Tiny is pretty good for use with web search MCP in LM studio, it's my go to for that and it does better than some Qwen models. Haven't tried Nano yet, tempted, maybe I should :)
   💬 Replies (4):
   4.1. (10 ⬆️) https://i.redd.it/79by85q8awxf1.gif
   4.2. (6 ⬆️) Better than Qwen in what ways? 

I want to use Tiny over Qwen3 4B as my default for web search on iOS, but I still haven’t found a system prompt to make Tiny to format sources consistently just yet.
   4.3. (1 ⬆️) Which MCP do you use for web search?
   4.4. (1 ⬆️) Maybe a silly question, but I had no idea you could even do such a thing. How would you set up the model for web search? Is it a perplexity-like experience?

5. (7 ⬆️) Will your upcoming vision models be good at providing bounding box coordinates to identify objects in an image?
   💬 Replies (2):
   5.1. (6 ⬆️) This isn't currently on our roadmap, but we will pass this along to our Research team. Our Granite Docling model offers a similar capability for documents, so it is not out of the realm of possibility for our future vision models.

   5.2. (1 ⬆️) Do you know any models which do this well outside of the Gemini family?

6. (7 ⬆️) Is the training recipe and data made public ? How open is open here ? 
   💬 Replies (1):
   6.1. (14 ⬆️) For our Granite 3.0 family, we released an in-depth paper outlining our thorough training process as well as the complete list of data sources used for training. We are currently working on the same for Granite 4.0, but wanted to get the models out to the community ASAP and follow on with the paper ...

7. (5 ⬆️) For those struggling with tool calling with Granite models in llama.cpp, it could be [this bug](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/16415) (or something else, I am not exactly sure).

8. (5 ⬆️) Wow, those IFEval scores are really impressive for a 1B.

9. (4 ⬆️) Is there a plan to update Granite’s training data to have a more recent knowledge cut off?

10. (3 ⬆️) Just wanted to add that the granite team @ IBM is extremely responsive, smart, and frankly just easy to work with. Great for enterprise use cases!

   1.2. (1 ⬆️) I looked into few hands, e.g. Hand #107 - not even the bigger fishes play that bad as Llama 4 does there.

Hey everyone!  We've been quietly grinding, and today, we're pumped to share the new release of KaniTTS English, as well as Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Korean and Arabic models.  Benchmark on [VastAI](https://vast.ai/): RTF (Real-Time Factor) of ~0.2 on RTX4080, ~0.5 on RTX3060.  It has 400M parameters. We achieved this speed by pairing an [LFM2-350M](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2-350M ) backbone with an efficient [NanoCodec](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemo-nano-codec-22khz-0.6kbps-12.5fps).  It's released under the Apache 2.0 License so you can use it for almost anything.

Soul has just released SoulX-Podcast-1.7B, which looks like it might be trained based on Qwen3-1.7B. The current demo looks promising, but it's hard to say what the actual performance is like. I previously tested VibeVoice-1.5B and found that its performance was very poor during rapid switching between multiple speakers. I'm wondering if this new model will be any better.

There is a lot of whitespace still in the client applications and I support more choice beyond Open WebUI. WebUI has its place but it’s not for everyone.

9. (1 ⬆️) There are many many many such projects - if you could share information such as long term goal, dev sustainability, etc it will help potential users like me (who do want to move away from OpenWebUI) use and support you. 

Please also share how AI is used to generate code (vibe coded or a robust agentic system with a full SQA sutie).

10. (1 ⬆️) nah I’m good. OWUI is tried and tested, and has an active user and contributor community which ensures that it runs reliably. There are *tons* of also-rans in this space.

I've been analysing the Artificial Analysis benchmark set (94 production models, 329 API endpoints) and wanted to share some trends that seem notable.  **Context**    This is models with commercial API access, not the full experimental OS landscape. So mostly models you'd actually deploy out of the box rather than every research models  The gap between best tracked OS (MiniMax-M2, quality 61) and best proprietary (GPT-5, 68) is now 7 points. Last year it was around 18 points in the same dataset. Linear extrapolation suggests parity by Q2 2026 for production-ready models, though obviously that assumes the trend holds (and chinese labs keep shipping OSS models)  What's interesting is the tier distribution:  \- Elite (60+): 1 OS, 11 proprietary   \- High (50-59): 8 OS, 8 proprietary (we hit parity here)   \- Below 50: OS dominates by volume  The economics are pretty stark.    OS average: $0.83/M tokens.    Proprietary: $6.03/M.    Value leaders like Qwen3-235B are hitting 228 quality per ...

Hi all, I'm Anton from Nebius.  We’ve updated the **SWE-rebench** leaderboard with model evaluations of GLM-4.6 on 49 fresh tasks.  Key takeaways:  * **GLM 4.6** joins the leaderboard and is now the **best open-source performer**, achieving **37.0 % resolved rate** and **42.9 % pass@5**, surpassing **GLM 4.5**.  Check out the full leaderboard and insights here, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to see other models evaluated.

1. (18 ⬆️) Thanks a lot because SWE-rebench is one of my favourite benches. I was not even a GLM fan before but I must say they are really smashing it these days. GLM 4.6 is a great model in a variety of different ways.

8. (1 ⬆️) Gpt-5-mini medium and glm 4.6 over gpt-5-high? Interesting stuff. We told you all glm is good if you use it full weight and with thinking. But realistically my experience differs here, gpt-5-high beats Sonnet 4.5 and everything in so many use-cases that I personally had.

9. (1 ⬆️) I genuinely don't believe that Sonnet 4.5 is better than 4. Sonnet 4.5 does a lot of very stupid things, doesn't adapt, and can't solve some of the problems that 4 solves every time.

OpenAI has committed to spend about $1.4 trillion on infrastructure so far, equating to roughly 30 gigawatts of data center capacity, CEO Sam Altman said on Tuesday.  The statement helps clarify the many announcements the company has made with its chip, data center and financing partners. That total includes the already announced deals with AMD, Broadcom, Nvidia, Oracle and other partners. That's just the starting point, Altman said. Over time, the company would like to have in place a technical and financial apparatus that would allow it to build a gigawatt of new capacity per week at a cost of around $20 billion per gigawatt.

eels like the pace of AI adoption has gone from “experimental” to “everywhere” almost overnight.   We keep hearing about automation and agents changing how things work — but it’s hard to tell which industries are actually feeling it right now versus just talking about it.  Which sectors do you think are already seeing real disruption- not in theory, but in day-to-day operations, jobs, or business models?

2. (6 ⬆️) From what I have seen so far, marketing and customer support are already deep in it. Teams are quietly replacing routine workflows with AI agents that handle outreach, ticket sorting, and even live interactions.

Hey r/AI_Agents! We’re Robin, Louis, and Thomas. We got bored of rebuilding the same agentic patterns for clients over and over, so we turned those patterns into **Pipelex**, an open-source DSL which reads like documentation + Python runtime for **repeatable AI workflows**.  Think **Dockerfile/SQL for multi-step LLM pipelines**: you declare steps and interfaces; the runtime figures out how to run them with whatever model/provider you choose.  **Why this vs. another workflow builder?**  * **Declarative, not glue code** — describe *what* to do; the runtime orchestrates the *how*. * **Agent-first** — each step carries natural-language context (purpose + conceptual inputs/outputs) so LLMs can follow, audit, and optimize. We expose this via an **MCP server** so agents can *run* pipelines or even *build new ones on demand*. * **Open standard (MIT)** — language spec, runtime, API server, editor extensions, MCP server, and an n8n node. * **Composable** — a pipe can call other pipes you build o...

1. (8 ⬆️) This looks really promising. The declarative approach is exactly what so many agent frameworks have been missing. Instead of chaining prompts together with fragile glue code, Pipelex seems to treat workflows like a shared language between humans and models.

Amazon plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs—its largest layoffs in years—explicitly to invest in AI. HR chief Beth Galetti called AI "the most transformative technology since the internet," while CEO Andy Jassy warned months ago that the company would need "fewer people" as AI drives efficiency.  This isn't just Amazon's story; it's a warning. White-collar roles once seen as safe are vanishing first, replaced by systems that prioritize speed over human judgment. The result?

Picture a game like Riot Games, and how they'd use AI for Customer Service. Say they wanted to use an LLM to determine if reports made by the players against other players are fair. If there's a player spewing obscenities in the report, the LLM/AI model would easily know, obviously, this is wrong, ban.   **But CEOs are terrified of job elimination**  They've laid off some people. 100k here, 30k there... but this is a small number compared to laying off millions.

6. (10 ⬆️) I agree there will be more layoffs but I don't agree employers are terrified. I think they in general are happy to do anything to increase their profits and they don't care about firing people. This is especially true of publicly traded companies because whenever they fire thousands of people their stock price rises. And that leads to bigger executive bonuses. It's the sad truth about capitalism. In its purest form it does not care about people at all.

We keep hearing that *AI is everywhere..* copilots, assistants, automation for everything.  But it’s wild how many companies have **said** they’re using AI when they actually weren’t.  A few examples that still blow my mind:  * **Builder ai** raised $500M claiming it could auto-build apps with AI. In reality? Hundreds of outsourced developers doing the work manually. * **Amazon Go’s “just walk out” stores** \- marketed as cashier-less thanks to AI vision. Turns out, it relied on teams of humans in India watching camera feeds. * **Banjo**, which sold “crime prediction AI” to US law enforcement - an audit later found it didn’t even meet the definition of artificial intelligence.  Although AI is growing like crazy, sometimes its more of a marketing strategy than an actual product.      And lately, some companies doing mass layoffs and claiming “AI efficiencies” are actually just **outsourcing the same work for cheaper**.   What other examples of “AI-washing” have you seen?       and what ...

1. (17 ⬆️) There is a little bit of naivety in some of the examples. Like I think Amazon truly believed that after those Indians watched all the camera feeds and input their results that eventually they'd have gotten a dataset good enough to actually train AI to do it.

It's a bit of horse before the cart, because you can't really get training data without a real store and without real customers and without real goods on the shelves. Maybe a team of actors can make a few hundred thousand data training poin...

There's a petition to require clear tagging/labeling of AI generated content on social media websites as well as the ability to hide that content from your feed. Not a ban, if you feel like playing with midjourney or sora all day knock yourself out, but the ability to selectively hide it so that your feed is less muddled with artificial content.       Pinterest is already basically doing this, and the technology is all out there. Content moderation has long been a standard practice, websites and apps already exist to dynamically analyze and detect AI imagery.

Post Content:
OpenAI’s own research found that hundreds of thousands of ChatGPT users show signs of suicidal or psychotic distress every week.  Many studies have shown that chatbots can sometimes worsen those feelings instead of helping - and some families even allege that the chatbot fueled their delusions and paranoia. Mental health experts started calling this AI psychosis, though there hasn’t been solid data on how widespread it really is until now.  But at the same time, tons of people say using AI for therapy or emotional support has helped them more than any human therapist ever has.  It’s such a strange contradiction: for some it’s super comforting, for others it’s very dangerous.

AI can indeed act as a therapy bot, but 99.99% of them are not designed for this, and when you use an AI bot improperly as a therapist, you get suicides like the kid who started all this fuss. (That is **NOT** me saying it's the kids fault.)
