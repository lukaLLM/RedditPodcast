There might be more bad news about the DGX Spark!  Before it was even released, I told everyone that this thing has a memory bandwidth problem. Although it boasts 1 PFLOPS of FP4 floating-point performance, its memory bandwidth is only 273GB/s. This will cause major stuttering when running large models (with performance being roughly only one-third of a MacStudio M2 Ultra).  Today, more bad news emerged: the floating-point performance doesn't even reach 1 PFLOPS.  Tests from two titans of the industry‚ÄîJohn Carmack (founder of id Software, developer of games like Doom, and a name every programmer should know from the legendary fast inverse square root algorithm) and Awni Hannun (the primary lead of Apple's large model framework, MLX)‚Äîhave shown that this device only achieves 480 TFLOPS of FP4 performance (approximately 60 TFLOPS BF16). That's less than half of the advertised performance.  Furthermore, if you run it for an extended period, it will overheat and restart.  It's currently un...

   1.1. (39 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's actually more like 50% more than a AMD Max+ 395. You have to get the "low spec" version of the Spark though. That being a 1TB PCIe 4 SSD instead of a 4TB PCIe 5 SSD. Considering that some 4TB SSDs have been available for around $200 lately, I think that downgrade is worth saving $1000. So the 1...

2. (106 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) This is an extreme case of schadenfreude for me. Nvidia has seen astronomical growth in their stock and GPUs over the last 5 years. They have completely dominated the market and charge outrageous prices for their GPUs. 

When it comes to building a standalone AI product, which should be something they should absolutely crush out of the park, they failed miserably.

7. (29 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) > a name every programmer should know from the legendary fast inverse square root algorithm

John Carmack didn't invent the fast inverse square root.

Greg Walsh wrote the famous implementation, and he was only one of a line of contributors in its creation going back as far as 1986

https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/e_sqrt.c

   7.1. (8 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) My bad
   7.2. (4 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) To be fair, it's done slightly differently in his code than fdlibm's implementation.

8. (18 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Measured image diffusion generation on DGX Spark was around 3x slower than on 5090. Roughly the level of 3090 which was 568 INT4 dense and 1136 sparse INT4, but had 71 TFLOPs dense BF16 with FP32 accumulate and 142  FP16 TFlops dense with FP16 accumulate. 

So performance is as expected in there. Maybe Spark has the same 2x slowdown with BF16 with FP32 accumulate as 3090 has.
Just pure speculation based on Ampere whitepaper.

Glyph: Scaling Context Windows via Visual-Text Compression  Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2510.17800  Weights: huggingface.co/zai-org/Glyph  Repo: github.com/thu-coai/Glyph  Glyph is a framework for scaling the context length through visual-text compression. It renders long textual sequences into images and processes them using vision‚Äìlanguage models.  This design transforms the challenge of long-context modeling into a multimodal problem, substantially reducing computational and memory costs while preserving semantic information.

4. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) This is another example of how Chinese companies are aiming for efficiency rather than exquisite capabilities.

Edit: couldn't find a mention of jpeg in the paper. They might just mean scaling down tokens and words down to single pixels with compression (csn still apply png compression on that while staying lossless I guess but is not specifically mentioned)
   üí¨ Replies (2):
   7.1. (4 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) LLMs can't process jpegs directly, they need to be decoded to raw bitmaps which are then encoded into an embedding using a vision encoder

Besides, jpeg is an ancient, obsolete codec.

Webp, avif and jxl achieve significantly lower filesizes while being higher quality
   7.2. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Not tokens and words down to *single* pixels, the pixels still need to be arranged in a way that carries information, i.e. in the shape of a letter or word.

Hello guys, hope you're fine.  Short question, I managed to find, working and testing on my PC right now, an A40 48GB. It is passively cooled and it gets quite hot.  [Local testing on my PC](https://preview.redd.it/8az1kqsdyqxf1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=301fff8d7b8d78a3f33c97765bb96ebdeaa03e2d)  The seller (a friend) is asking me 1500USD for it. I'm not from USA, but a 3rd world country.  But I have read here on Local llama that such old cards and such aren't very worth it, also no FP8 support, etc.  So I'm really torn and indecisive about it. For reference, 5090 new goes for about 2700-3300USD (so 32GB, but fp8/fp4 support, like 4x times the bandwidth, etc). Used 4090s are 1600USD. 4090 48GB modded when importing they're about 4200-4400USD. 3090s are 550-600USD.  What would you guys do? Thanks!

1. (102 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) A40 is still very capable, and will continue to be sp for a few years at least. If you can get it for $1500 without any other hidden fees in working condition, and you can afford it, it's fantastic value. But beware: those cards typically sell well above $5000 ($2000 for 24GB vetsion), so you might be looking at a scam.

Aw man I'm still debating about it...
   1.2. (-2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) They shouldn't be selling for that anymore considering the Blackwell 5000 48gb is superior in every way to the A6000/A40 and is $4500 brand new. 

Even the RTX 6000 Ada/L40S (Ada Lovelace, i.e. 4090-series) is slipping down to ~$5000-5500.

   1.1. (13 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Hello IBM, I have a question - what about bigger models? Like 70B or something :)
   1.2. (4 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Do you guys have a reasoning model in the pipeline?
   1.3. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Any plans to release Granite 4 versions of the RAG/Security LoRAs that you guys have for Granite 3.3?
   1.4. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) the granite 1B model is closer to 2 billion params?
   1.5. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Is this tuned for tools use? 
What else we expect?

2. (8 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Love the 0.3B (300M) to 0.6B (600M) category

3. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The lfm nanos didn't really work for me. Let's see how this goes

4. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Wow, those IFEval scores are really impressive for a 1B.

5. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Is there a plan to update Granite‚Äôs training data to have a more recent knowledge cut off?

6. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Only 16 heads :'c

But gonna give it a shot vs old 2b. I hope it will be able to learn to the same level while being 30% smaller.

7. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Will your upcoming vision models be good at providing bounding box coordinates to identify objects in an image?

8. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The Granite Tiny is pretty good for use with web search MCP in LM studio, it's my go to for that and it does better than some Qwen models. Haven't tried Nano yet, tempted, maybe I should :)

   2.1. (5 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's about what you'd expect, a 22b at 4bit gets 26 or 27 tok/s on mlx and this is a 10b so it's in the right ballpark.
   2.2. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è)  > Yeah I know prompt processing is a little bit low

I don't think that the reported pp is accurate. If you look closer, it only processed 23 tokens. To get a better pp reading, it would be necessary to run it over a bigger prompt.

10B active parameters, so it is ...
   2.3. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) this is not surprising, but the PP speed is slower than other 100B models. I think they will have to optimize it and it will likely be faster in next commit

3. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) If someone connects 3 M3 ultra machines together, will it able to produce more than 100tk/s with 50% context windows.  
Or for something like GLM 4.6 will it be able to run at a decent speed?

I do feel that bandwidth is the bottle neck, but if you know who did it, please mention.
   üí¨ Replies (2):
   3.1. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) you're right - bandwidth is the bottleneck for a lot of this, so chaining together is not going to make things any faster. It would technically allow you to run larger or higher quant models, but I don't think that's very worth it over just having the single 512GB model.
   3.2. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Someone already did this to run deepseek at q8, they got like 10 tokens per second. It‚Äôs on youtube somewhere.

There is a lot of whitespace still in the client applications and I support more choice beyond Open WebUI. WebUI has its place but it‚Äôs not for everyone.

We have had a need for a much lighter client application that can connect to OpenAI-compatible endpoints so your single-file contribution is well received here.

Thank you

5. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) FWIW, I just asked Claude to write me one. Simple web server but it does what I want:

1. (23 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I find it odd they left out prompt prefill tokens/s which is arguably way more important than output tokens/s. Still surprising it performs pretty close to an RTX 6000 Ada for their MSRP. At MSRP there is no reason to buy super old super used RTX 3090s anymore as long as these will stay in stock.

It really depends on the use case. Some are prefill bottlenecked, others are generation bottlenecked.
   1.2. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Not an entirely apples to apples comparison. The 3090 has 50% more memory bandwidth and unless you buy on ebay, you can get them for 500-550.

3. (8 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Pretty bad article.  Testing 7B model with these cards was a joke.  The condition hardly stresses these cards.  They are probably bottlenecked by other factors.  Tests on the 14B model clearly show RTX 6000 ada is better.  They should test an 8-bit 32B model with 2 R9700 and 6000 ada.

That have CUDA support, are gaming capable and have a lot less driver shenanigans.

2. (21 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) In spite of the bad press, talking to AI about mental health problems including depression (and I suppose suicide), can be very helpful. It is safer if they aren't sycophantic, and aren't super obedient / instruct tuned, but it's pretty good either way.

   2.1. (7 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) You can‚Äôt even talk to a therapist about killing yourself because they are obligated to report and you‚Äôll end up in a ward for a couple days. I have thought about this before but I knew not to be completely honest with my therapist because of this.
   2.2. (5 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Furthermore it's not always self ideation. Many people are impacted by this through the poeple they know who struggle with it.

   3.1. (11 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I guess it tells us that we do not have an effective treatment for most mental health problems and chat bots seem to provide some need for depressed people.
   3.2. (7 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) That around 1-2% of people think about suicide? I think that has always been the case and is about a normal %.

4. (6 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Well, when considering the neglect of mental health provider access, then this becomes obvious.

5. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Not a surprise.

6. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's not surprising and it's honestly not the only private or disturbing thing that people would talk about with an AI. For whatever its flaws, it's "relatively" judgement free and the placation and glazzing that typically galls us so much, might actually uplift some people from dark places.

7. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Privacy used to be valued

The family of Adam Raine, who died by suicide in April 2025, alleges that OpenAI deliberately weakened safety protocols just months before his death. According to court documents, Raine's ChatGPT usage skyrocketed from dozens of daily conversations in January to over 300 by April, with self-harm content increasing from 1.6% to 17% of his messages.  "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times, six times more than Adam himself did," the lawsuit states.

1. (13 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Pretty much the only type of agent working well so far is coding agent (claude code, codex, etc).

2. (10 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Right now, it's pretty good to have the agent handle repetitive and simple tasks.  
  
I love reading novels, but I often forget the earlier parts by the time I get to the later ones. So, I developed a simple agent.  
  
This agent helps me map out all the character relationships into a graph database and then organizes a timeline of important events.  
  
It's quite convenient and makes reading more efficient.

eels like the pace of AI adoption has gone from ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù to ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù almost overnight.   We keep hearing about automation and agents changing how things work ‚Äî but it‚Äôs hard to tell which industries are actually feeling it right now versus just talking about it.  Which sectors do you think are already seeing real disruption- not in theory, but in day-to-day operations, jobs, or business models?

1. (21 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Well I can say for the freelance/outsourcing industry is massively disrupted for sure. The things people could hire some external to do with limited context is quite easily replaceable. Here are some businesses I know are personally facing a hard time

1. Creative/Photography for Business: A lot of my friends used to get hired to create marketing assets, photoshoots etc for businesses. Tools like Google Nano Banana etc is easily replacing them real quick
2. SEO Agencies: Content writing and SEO ...

   1.1. (12 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Call centers are nowhere close to being replaced with AI, and neither are developers.
   1.2. (6 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I would disagree with you about coding. I'm a developer, and yes, many non engineering teams build their MVPs with AI, but they get stuck very soon. AI is not there yet to build full-fledge scalable products.
   1.3. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) i work in translation QC, the amount of stuff that was clearly translated using machine is increasing exponentialy with every project i work on.
   1.4. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) narrators, like the voice over for SME commercials (small-middle-sized enterprises)

2. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) the biggest industries already feeling it are customer support, marketing, coding, and media. support teams are downsizing because ai agents handle most routine tickets now.

3. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Amazon

4. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I think software development has been completely disrupted! We aren‚Äôt there yet where we can actually let AI models update software independently. But as a senior software engineer, the ability to finish projects faster using Cursor or Claude Code is unbelievable.

Also, having an AI agent review PRs, collaborate on architecture, and get me up to speed on new concepts is immensely valuable. I still ground myself in real docs every time, but it‚Äôs a faster Google.

   4.2. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It's just another tool and skillset for developers. I honestly don't see it as anything different than the introduction of IDEs.
   4.3. (0 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Faster. But AI is NEVER going to replace developers. Any company that does that is literally going to cause itself to implode.

Pretty much out, unless it is really high talent / high stakes e.g. Literature translation, diplomatic talks.

**Everyday use illustrations / stock photography**  
Unless my biz is riding on this, I will not pay an artist anymore.

6. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Any industry where codes/numbers have been assigned for activities in the world.

7. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) I am the CEO of a software company operating in the healthcare space. We are not a large enterprise but also not a tiny startup. We are seeing massive disruption, leading to changing our hiring roadmap; we are also realizing leagues of increased productivity for every current team member on our payroll. I have zero intention of letting any current employees go due to AI, but every intention of upskilling those on payroll, increasing their earnings, and prioritizing agentic systems where possible...

8. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The honest answer? Most industries are stuck between "talking about it" and "actually disrupted."

I work inside Fortune 500 AI implementations daily. What I'm seeing is a massive gap between what's possible and what's actually changing how work gets done.

CPG seems to be moving fastest, driven partly by how impactful innovation and speed to market can be in market share and the relative speed and necessity of new products/packaging/formulations needing to be updated often anyways. They are not...

9. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) From what I have seen so far, marketing and customer support are already deep in it. Teams are quietly replacing routine workflows with AI agents that handle outreach, ticket sorting, and even live interactions. Finance is another one; AI tools are being used for reconciliation, fraud detection, and compliance checks with far fewer human hours involved.

I have also noticed early shifts in web operations, especially where agents interact directly with browser interfaces. Tools like Hyperbrowser ...

10. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Real wins = boring automation. Pretty UI demos are fun, but invoice bots are making bank.

Amazon plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs‚Äîits largest layoffs in years‚Äîexplicitly to invest in AI. HR chief Beth Galetti called AI "the most transformative technology since the internet," while CEO Andy Jassy warned months ago that the company would need "fewer people" as AI drives efficiency.  This isn't just Amazon's story; it's a warning. White-collar roles once seen as safe are vanishing first, replaced by systems that prioritize speed over human judgment. The result? Growing unemployment, skill gaps, and dangerous over-reliance on AI.

7. (5 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The thing to watch is how much AI are they using? By AI mean Actually Indians. Many of these layoffs see Tata or Infosys moving in. Keep in mind that US courts have said paying an H1B 30% less than prevailing wage is NOT considered negatively impacting wages.¬†

10. (3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) This is what will continue to happen as long as tech billionaires are running the country.  AI will rapidly take jobs from people and the company won‚Äôt subsidize basic living income, because that kills profit.  The economy can‚Äôt handle AI progression to taking jobs while the system is in a full capitalism mode, the few who control the majority of business will look for profit before all else and this will ruin people, change is needed.

We either get this right, and things become awesome.

Or we get it wrong, and this is our swan song.

   1.1. (13 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) It will be like all new tech, progress will come in fits and spurts, there will be setbacks and dead-ends, it will take longer than expected, there will be competing approaches, etc.  It's not a single thing that we get right or wrong.
   1.2. (2 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) Nope. The tech is in its infancy and break more then crate in places. But one thing it's created for sure is a huge financial bubble, that also translates in extremely power hungry datacenters playing strongly against CO2 reductuon plans.

Governments want AI to automate their economies, and they will spend trillions to have data centres built in their countries. They aren‚Äôt going to sit back and watch an issue of private monetary and profit halt production and therefore also adoption of AI within their economies.

I think this is more about finding cheaper land and resources for big multinational corp to plant their datacenter rather than Indonesian seeking any kind of AI sovereignty whatsoever. The datacenters will be owned by foreign firm serving foreign customer. No doubt about that.

3. (1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) The only reason this is important is because they have the term "AGI" in their contract. I think Microsoft signed that one expecting it to never happen, but OpenAI has their own little special definition of what exactly that means. They've been negotiating this for a while. Last go around OpenAI wanted it to be "once it makes a $100 billion dollars in revenue". 

Now they've agreed someone else gets to decide what it means. 

Pretty forgiving of OpenAI, you know, considering the attempted coup.
