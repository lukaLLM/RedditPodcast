Post Content:
There might be more bad news about the DGX Spark!  Before it was even released, I told everyone that this thing has a memory bandwidth problem. Although it boasts 1 PFLOPS of FP4 floating-point performance, its memory bandwidth is only 273GB/s. This will cause major stuttering when running large models (with performance being roughly only one-third of a MacStudio M2 Ultra).  Today, more bad news emerged: the floating-point performance doesn't even reach 1 PFLOPS.  Tests from two titans of the industry—John Carmack (founder of id Software, developer of games like Doom, and a name every programmer should know from the legendary fast inverse square root algorithm) and Awni Hannun (the primary lead of Apple's large model framework, MLX)—have shown that this device only achieves 480 TFLOPS of FP4 performance (approximately 60 TFLOPS BF16). That's less than half of the advertised performance.  Furthermore, if you run it for an extended period, it will overheat and restart.  It's currently un...

1. (217 ⬆️) Jesus, not only it costs twice what the AMD version does, it's also has half the claimed performance (probably due to inadequate cooling?)

   1.1. (39 ⬆️) It's actually more like 50% more than a AMD Max+ 395. You have to get the "low spec" version of the Spark though. That being a 1TB PCIe 4 SSD instead of a 4TB PCIe 5 SSD. Considering that some 4TB SSDs have been available for around $200 lately, I think that downgrade is worth saving $1000. So the 1...

2. (106 ⬆️) This is an extreme case of schadenfreude for me. Nvidia has seen astronomical growth in their stock and GPUs over the last 5 years. They have completely dominated the market and charge outrageous prices for their GPUs. 

When it comes to building a standalone AI product, which should be something they should absolutely crush out of the park, they failed miserably. 

Don’t buy this product. Do not support companies that overcharge and underdeliver. Their monopoly needs to die.

   5.1. (30 ⬆️) Unless you need Cuda. It's the Nvidia tax all over again, you have to pay up if you want good developer tooling. The price of the Spark would be worth it if you're counting developer time and ease of use; we plebs using it for local inference aren't part of Nvidia's target market.

7. (29 ⬆️) > a name every programmer should know from the legendary fast inverse square root algorithm

John Carmack didn't invent the fast inverse square root.

Greg Walsh wrote the famous implementation, and he was only one of a line of contributors in its creation going back as far as 1986

https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/e_sqrt.c

   💬 Replies (2):
   7.1. (8 ⬆️) My bad
   7.2. (4 ⬆️) To be fair, it's done slightly differently in his code than fdlibm's implementation.

8. (18 ⬆️) Measured image diffusion generation on DGX Spark was around 3x slower than on 5090. Roughly the level of 3090 which was 568 INT4 dense and 1136 sparse INT4, but had 71 TFLOPs dense BF16 with FP32 accumulate and 142  FP16 TFlops dense with FP16 accumulate. 

So performance is as expected in there. Maybe Spark has the same 2x slowdown with BF16 with FP32 accumulate as 3090 has.
Just pure speculation based on Ampere whitepaper.

Assuming prices don't change much, for the same price as the DGX you can get a M5 Max with over 2x the memory bandwidth for the same price and for 1200 to 1500 more you can get an Ultra with 256 GB mem...

Glyph: Scaling Context Windows via Visual-Text Compression  Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2510.17800  Weights: huggingface.co/zai-org/Glyph  Repo: github.com/thu-coai/Glyph  Glyph is a framework for scaling the context length through visual-text compression. It renders long textual sequences into images and processes them using vision–language models.  This design transforms the challenge of long-context modeling into a multimodal problem, substantially reducing computational and memory costs while preserving semantic information.

4. (2 ⬆️) This is another example of how Chinese companies are aiming for efficiency rather than exquisite capabilities. Increasingly sparse architectures, increase parse/hybrid, attention, mechanisms, and now these different ways of extending context through visual compression.

7. (0 ⬆️) So we're using jpeg compression to compress context now? That's pretty smart


Edit: couldn't find a mention of jpeg in the paper. They might just mean scaling down tokens and words down to single pixels with compression (csn still apply png compression on that while staying lossless I guess but is not specifically mentioned)
   💬 Replies (2):
   7.1. (4 ⬆️) LLMs can't process jpegs directly, they need to be decoded to raw bitmaps which are then encoded into an embedding using a vision encoder

Besides, jpeg is an ancient, obsolete codec.

Webp, avif and jxl achieve significantly lower filesizes while being higher quality
   7.2. (1 ⬆️) Not tokens and words down to *single* pixels, the pixels still need to be arranged in a way that carries information, i.e. in the shape of a letter or word.

Hello guys, hope you're fine.  Short question, I managed to find, working and testing on my PC right now, an A40 48GB. It is passively cooled and it gets quite hot.  [Local testing on my PC](https://preview.redd.it/8az1kqsdyqxf1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=301fff8d7b8d78a3f33c97765bb96ebdeaa03e2d)  The seller (a friend) is asking me 1500USD for it. I'm not from USA, but a 3rd world country.  But I have read here on Local llama that such old cards and such aren't very worth it, also no FP8 support, etc.  So I'm really torn and indecisive about it. For reference, 5090 new goes for about 2700-3300USD (so 32GB, but fp8/fp4 support, like 4x times the bandwidth, etc). Used 4090s are 1600USD. 4090 48GB modded when importing they're about 4200-4400USD. 3090s are 550-600USD.  What would you guys do? Thanks!

1. (102 ⬆️) A40 is still very capable, and will continue to be sp for a few years at least. If you can get it for $1500 without any other hidden fees in working condition, and you can afford it, it's fantastic value. But beware: those cards typically sell well above $5000 ($2000 for 24GB vetsion), so you might be looking at a scam.

   💬 Replies (3):
   2.1. (5 ⬆️) It's about what you'd expect, a 22b at 4bit gets 26 or 27 tok/s on mlx and this is a 10b so it's in the right ballpark.
   2.2. (2 ⬆️)  > Yeah I know prompt processing is a little bit low

I don't think that the reported pp is accurate. If you look closer, it only processed 23 tokens. To get a better pp reading, it would be necessary to run it over a bigger prompt.

10B active parameters, so it is ...
   2.3. (1 ⬆️) this is not surprising, but the PP speed is slower than other 100B models. I think they will have to optimize it and it will likely be faster in next commit

3. (1 ⬆️) If someone connects 3 M3 ultra machines together, will it able to produce more than 100tk/s with 50% context windows.  
Or for something like GLM 4.6 will it be able to run at a decent speed?

I do feel that bandwidth is the bottle neck, but if you know who did it, please mention.
   💬 Replies (2):
   3.1. (3 ⬆️) you're right - bandwidth is the bottleneck for a lot of this, so chaining together is not going to make things any faster. It would technically allow you to run larger or higher quant models, but I don't think that's very worth it over just having the single 512GB model.
   3.2. (1 ⬆️) Someone already did this to run deepseek at q8, they got like 10 tokens per second. It’s on youtube somewhere.

There is a lot of whitespace still in the client applications and I support more choice beyond Open WebUI. WebUI has its place but it’s not for everyone.

We have had a need for a much lighter client application that can connect to OpenAI-compatible endpoints so your single-file contribution is well received here.

Thank you

1. (23 ⬆️) I find it odd they left out prompt prefill tokens/s which is arguably way more important than output tokens/s. Still surprising it performs pretty close to an RTX 6000 Ada for their MSRP. At MSRP there is no reason to buy super old super used RTX 3090s anymore as long as these will stay in stock.

It really depends on the use case. Some are prefill bottlenecked, others are generation bottlenecked.
   1.2. (1 ⬆️) Not an entirely apples to apples comparison. The 3090 has 50% more memory bandwidth and unless you buy on ebay, you can get them for 500-550.

3. (8 ⬆️) Pretty bad article.  Testing 7B model with these cards was a joke.  The condition hardly stresses these cards.  They are probably bottlenecked by other factors.  Tests on the 14B model clearly show RTX 6000 ada is better.  They should test an 8-bit 32B model with 2 R9700 and 6000 ada.

The family of Adam Raine, who died by suicide in April 2025, alleges that OpenAI deliberately weakened safety protocols just months before his death. According to court documents, Raine's ChatGPT usage skyrocketed from dozens of daily conversations in January to over 300 by April, with self-harm content increasing from 1.6% to 17% of his messages.  "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times, six times more than Adam himself did," the lawsuit states.

I love reading novels, but I often forget the earlier parts by the time I get to the later ones. So, I developed a simple agent.

We keep hearing about automation and agents changing how things work — but it’s hard to tell which industries are actually feeling it right now versus just talking about it.  Which sectors do you think are already seeing real disruption- not in theory, but in day-to-day operations, jobs, or business models?

TOP 10 COMMENTS

1. (21 ⬆️) Well I can say for the freelance/outsourcing industry is massively disrupted for sure. The things people could hire some external to do with limited context is quite easily replaceable. Here are some businesses I know are personally facing a hard time

   1.4. (1 ⬆️) narrators, like the voice over for SME commercials (small-middle-sized enterprises)

2. (3 ⬆️) the biggest industries already feeling it are customer support, marketing, coding, and media. support teams are downsizing because ai agents handle most routine tickets now.

3. (3 ⬆️) Amazon

4. (2 ⬆️) I think software development has been completely disrupted! We aren’t there yet where we can actually let AI models update software independently. But as a senior software engineer, the ability to finish projects faster using Cursor or Claude Code is unbelievable.

I have also noticed early shifts in web operations, especially where agents interact directly with browser interfaces. Tools like Hyperbrowser ...

Amazon plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs—its largest layoffs in years—explicitly to invest in AI. HR chief Beth Galetti called AI "the most transformative technology since the internet," while CEO Andy Jassy warned months ago that the company would need "fewer people" as AI drives efficiency.  This isn't just Amazon's story; it's a warning. White-collar roles once seen as safe are vanishing first, replaced by systems that prioritize speed over human judgment. The result? Growing unemployment, skill gaps, and dangerous over-reliance on AI.

   1.1. (66 ⬆️) In Europe, kind of hoping they go down again. We already have a push towards moving away from American cloud services. 

Plus Amazon is not a good corporate citizen.
   1.2. (13 ⬆️) I understand
   1.3. (1 ⬆️) It’s not about us-east-1, it’s about how AWS do things, us-east-1 datacenter is the default for almost everything and everything is too reliant on us-east-1 making it a single point of failure
   1.4. (1 ⬆️) True

2. (193 ⬆️) Guys companies exist to turn a profit not to create jobs. If you accept simple truths like this then it's easy to predict the future a la Asiimov.
   💬 Replies (5):
   2.1. (70 ⬆️) That is a truth based on capitalism, maybe we need a new system where people, not companies are the main focus.
   2.2. (9 ⬆️) It’s more complicated than that though. Companies don’t exist in a vaccum, they have social impacts.
   2.3. (6 ⬆️) If they want to turn a profit though, why do they keep investing in a technology that keeps burning massive amounts of money with no profit in sight?
   2.4. (1 ⬆️) You’re not wrong but that’s still 14,000 livelihoods being misplaced because money.
   2.5. (1 ⬆️) Asiimov was very optimistic on AI, he saw a future where AI helped humans govern the world.

   3.2. (10 ⬆️) Is this /s…? COVID hiring was nearly 5-6 years ago are we still believing this bullshit narrative?
   3.3. (8 ⬆️) You're naive to accept a press conference statement from a multinational organisation at face value, gheesh
   3.4. (4 ⬆️) It’s not because over hiring. It’s because we are in a recession that is hidden behind the AI industry’s fake revenue from giving each other IOU’s.
   3.5. (3 ⬆️) Covid was 5 years ago. They’ve had plenty of time to correct for that.

   4.2. (2 ⬆️) They have to ride the final wave of "AI layoffs" before the bubble pops

5. (13 ⬆️) > Amazon is planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs beginning on Tuesday, as the company pares expenses and compensates for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic

But let's say it's because of AI so it sounds better

   6.1. (6 ⬆️) The most shocking and impressive thing I ever heard was that ChatGPT was rolled out at Klarna's customer service center, doing the work of 700 people in the call center and speaking 35 languages.

7. (5 ⬆️) The thing to watch is how much AI are they using? By AI mean Actually Indians. Many of these layoffs see Tata or Infosys moving in. Keep in mind that US courts have said paying an H1B 30% less than prevailing wage is NOT considered negatively impacting wages. 
   💬 Replies (1):
   7.1. (1 ⬆️) Even those firms had a layoff spree earlier this year, to tunes of 30-50k heads. Unsure if they are still on.

8. (4 ⬆️) Class warfare entering the final stages, which is how do they get rid of the angry jobless mob for good.
   💬 Replies (1):
   8.1. (-1 ⬆️) Or people could take some personal responsibility and stop shopping their. It’s insane how much people buy on Amazon and most of its needless shit no one ever needs.

9. (4 ⬆️) They’re not laying that many off because of AI. They’re laying people off because they keep building AI capacity that’s not getting used, companies aren’t buying, and is getting expensive so job losses are paying for it.

   9.1. (4 ⬆️) False, false, false. AWS reported a 17.5% jump in segment sales in its latest earnings report.

   9.2. (3 ⬆️) “Gross mismanagement”.  And the leaders that mismanaged are staying so they can guide incorrectly again and again.
   9.3. (0 ⬆️) Just so it's clear, this is literally entirely made up. It is impossible to even get the capacity needed from AI demand right now. It can't keep up.

10. (3 ⬆️) This is what will continue to happen as long as tech billionaires are running the country.  AI will rapidly take jobs from people and the company won’t subsidize basic living income, because that kills profit.  The economy can’t handle AI progression to taking jobs while the system is in a full capitalism mode, the few who control the majority of business will look for profit before all else and this will ruin people, change is needed.

1. (19 ⬆️) This is a "Once in humanity's existence" event.

We either get this right, and things become awesome.

Or we get it wrong, and this is our swan song.
   💬 Replies (3):
   1.1. (13 ⬆️) It will be like all new tech, progress will come in fits and spurts, there will be setbacks and dead-ends, it will take longer than expected, there will be competing approaches, etc.  It's not a single thing that we get right or wrong.
   1.2. (2 ⬆️) Nope. The tech is in its infancy and break more then crate in places. But one thing it's created for sure is a huge financial bubble, that also translates in extremely power hungry datacenters playing strongly against CO2 reductuon plans.
   1.3. (1 ⬆️) Very well said,seems like a pillar arrangement for our whole house(life structure)

2. (9 ⬆️) And people think the AI bubble will burst, lol. 

Governments want AI to automate their economies, and they will spend trillions to have data centres built in their countries. They aren’t going to sit back and watch an issue of private monetary and profit halt production and therefore also adoption of AI within their economies.

The idea that Nvidia will be reducing its production of chips, companies such as open AI will be scraping plans to build data centres, because the sector is unable to ex...

   2.1. (11 ⬆️) This does not mean the AI bubble won’t pop. Economically illiterate people often correlate AI bubble popping to AI advancement ceasing.
   2.2. (2 ⬆️) Where do these governments get the trillions that they're pumping into creating AI infrastructure from?
   2.3. (1 ⬆️) Governments don’t just have unlimited money.. especially if their economy is automated and all their workers are out of work. No more taxes means no more money. Right now we can at least print fiat currency backed by labor and taxes and stuff.. but then what? We’ll print currency backed truly by not...
   2.4. (1 ⬆️) AI can be an amazingly transformative technology and a bubble at the same time. 

Yes, I believe AI has amazing use cases and capabilities. No, I do not think the market is pricing it right, and I have concerns about various circular deals on wild expectations of future revenue.
   2.5. (1 ⬆️) It is not clear right now that having larger infrastructure actually enhance AI. It has been pointed out that smaller companys as Deepseek and Mistral are able to build LLM models as efficient as open AI  6 monthes to a year after those large companies with a very small fraction of their asset. So t...

3. (3 ⬆️) Plopping a data center somewhere doesn’t enrich the local population. Sure you get a good amount of jobs for a couple of years and then you’re just pouring electricity and water into it, and the profit is going to the companies extracting wealth out of it’s usage. Sure whoever owns the place will get money for leasing out compute I guess but you aren’t giving this money out to everybody on the local population. Unless I’m missing something here all the local population gets so far is less water ...

4. (2 ⬆️) FOMO is human nature. It's like crypto, only bigger.

5. (2 ⬆️) I am worried about Jakarta's electricity grid and water supply, lol. I think this is more about finding cheaper land and resources for big multinational corp to plant their datacenter rather than Indonesian seeking any kind of AI sovereignty whatsoever. The datacenters will be owned by foreign firm serving foreign customer. No doubt about that.

2. (8 ⬆️) Almost all Silicon Valley companies try to do the same thing - pick a market, find a way to insert themselves as a gateway middleman, and begin charging rent. Uber, DoorDash, even Amazon. 
The crazy thing is, the market for ai is almost any white collar job, as well as any blue collar job with repeatable steps and processes. That’s a lot of markets/jobs. If they can insert themselves as gateway middlemen into essentially ‘everything’ and begin charging rent , that is the ultimate goal.

3. (7 ⬆️) power, control, surveillance

4. (5 ⬆️) AI as a service subscription income.

5. (3 ⬆️) AI is a big field and there are many focus areas.  There is neuromorphic computer, binary neural networks, symbolic AI, and further research into LLMs.

And AGI has many theories and strategies like combining transformers with symbolic AI.  Or things like HTM or Hierarchical Temporal Memory.  Neuromorphic computer has SDTP ( spike dependent temporal plasticity) which is continually train or on chip learning

7. (3 ⬆️) Honestly, I think the **goal of AI research** really depends on *who you ask.*

* **Big tech companies** are chasing scale and control - building foundation models they can license, integrate, and monetize across everything from cloud to consumer tools.
* **Researchers** are focused on understanding general intelligence - alignment, reasoning, and autonomy.
* **Startups (and solo builders)** are working to *productize AI -* turning models into workflows that actually make people’s lives easier.

8. (2 ⬆️) There are 3 different goals from 3 sectors 1: Academia/ Research, 2: Company/ Capitalism & 3: Military.  
1 Academia: help expand science & speed up human & tech advancement, for the better of humanity  
2 Company: replace human labor, increase profit & market domination  
3 Military: fight & win wars without human cost

9. (2 ⬆️) middlemen rats, and the people who push planned obsolescence when we could have abundance and stability the greedy continue to ruin our lives. People are starting to wake up and realize the cloud is a lie some of the ai companies will push robots and eventually destroy old world capital hopefully ending all currency.

Hey there! I’ve been reading a [recent study](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/talk-trust-and-trade-offs_2025_web.pdf) and I’m worried about what’s happening with teens online. The report finds most platforms still lack age verification and important safety guardrails, and they’re designed to keep them engaged through constant validation and agreement - which can seriously mess with emotional development.  Just take a sec and look at this:  * About 72% of U.S. teens have used chatbots designed to feel like friends and 52% use them regularly. * One in three of those teens say they choose to talk to an AI instead of a real person for serious stuff. * Around 24% of them have shared real personal info (name, location, secrets) with these AI systems.

I remember high school as a place where the confident douches and the pretty girls were the most popular, humans can be ethically and morally deficient in social context. Might be why some choose to confide with a machine. 

Not saying there ain't issues with the point you're making but truly, many people are horrible persons.

Doesn't matter, teenagers are going to teenage - then they'll learn to adult in their own generational way.

A new definitive agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI will now allow the former to independently pursue AGI or in partnership with third parties. The companies announced that they've signed a new definitive agreement as the multibillion-dollar partnership enters the next phase. The new agreement paints a clear picture of Microsoft's stand and view about OpenAI's transition into a for-profit entity.[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-wont-sever-its-ties-with-microsoft-even-after-declaring-agi)  [https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-wont-sever-its-ties-with-microsoft-even-after-declaring-agi](https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-wont-sever-its-ties-with-microsoft-even-after-declaring-agi)

3. (1 ⬆️) The only reason this is important is because they have the term "AGI" in their contract. I think Microsoft signed that one expecting it to never happen, but OpenAI has their own little special definition of what exactly that means. They've been negotiating this for a while. Last go around OpenAI wanted it to be "once it makes a $100 billion dollars in revenue". 

Now they've agreed someone else gets to decide what it means. 

Pretty forgiving of OpenAI, you know, considering the attempted coup.
